aka **linguistic relativity**
principle that *suggests that the **structure and vocabulary** of a language can influence how its speakers **perceive** and **think** about the world*. 

For example, some languages have more words for colors than others, which may influence how speakers of those languages discriminate and remember colors.  Some languages have grammatical features that mark the gender, number, or evidentiality of a statement, which may influence how speakers of those languages judge the reliability or relevance of information. 

The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis has been **controversial** and debated among linguists, psychologists, and anthropologists.  Some versions of the hypothesis claim that language determines or limits thought, which is known as **linguistic determinism**. This is a strong and extreme view that has been *largely rejected* by most researchers. 

A more moderate and plausible version of the hypothesis claims that language influences or shapes thought, which is known as **linguistic relativism**. This is a weak and nuanced view that has been supported by some empirical evidence from various studies.
