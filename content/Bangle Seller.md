# Bangle Seller

a poem by **Sarojini Naidu**

## Summary
“The Bangle Sellers” is **about a group of bangle sellers** going to the **temple fair** to sell their
bangles. They describe the bangles vividly and urge the passers-by to buy their wares. The bangles also double as a way to explore womanhood and in particular, the transition of a girl into a woman. It talks about the way society treats women and reduces them to the roles of a daughter, a wife, or a mother.  A woman has no other role in society. 


## My Takeaway
employs irony, draws attention to the blatant sexism of patriarchy, how the bangle sellers are selling an illusion, an illusion we buy because we want to believe it too. 

first introduces iridescent bangles

then, silver and blue -> maidenhood/virginity
yellow, orange, red -> wifehood, consummation, marriage, lively
purple, gold, grey -> wisdom, maturity, age, completing 'duty'

*Rainbow-tinted circles of light*

*For happy daughters and happy wives* -> **their position is always in relation to men**

*Some are meet for a maiden's wrist*, -> maidenhood; same stanza has many references to a flower (buds, bloom, leaves). Innocence, 'purity', and virginity

**bangles represent a woman’s life** and **each color or type of bangle represents each stage of an Indian woman’s life**, from puberty to midlife.


RHYME SCHEME -> AABBCC | 
4 STANZAS, EACH = QUATRAIN + COUPLET

sunlit 
 flame of her marriage fire
 hue of heart's desire
bridal laughter and bridal tear

cradled fair sons
serves her household
worships the gods at her husband's side

The women are described as  
either happy ‘daughters’ or ‘wives.’
fit into boxes made by society 
poem is ironic

blue and silver (mountain mist), shades of pink (flower yet to blossom) is **maidenhood** and purity

yellow -> hope during bridal
reds and oranges (flame) -> passion, consummation
**wifehood**

purple and gold -> maturity, pride, royalty 
grey -> maturity and old age 
**motherhood**

### Anti-patriarchy
The patriarchal ideology lurks beneath the poem’s surface. The women are described as
either happy ‘daughters’ or ‘wives.’ Every phase she passes is referred to by a man in her life,
father, husband, sons. **The women in this poem are fit into boxes that limit their existence to being an object of patriarchy, a mere possession.** The poet writes how the society views women.
