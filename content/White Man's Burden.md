## Term 
refers to the idea that white people have a *moral obligation* to *civilize* and *educate* the non-white people of the world, especially those living in colonized or oppressed regions. 

The phrase was **popularized** by a poem of the same name by **[[Rudyard Kipling]]**, who wrote it in 1899 to urge the United States to take over the Philippines from Spain. 

Kipling portrayed [[colonialism]] as a noble and selfless mission that would benefit both the white and the non-white races, but also warned of the difficulties and dangers involved. The poem was widely criticized by anti-imperialists and people of color, who saw it as a racist and paternalistic **justification for exploitation and oppression**. 

The concept of the white man's burden was influenced by social Darwinism, Christian missionary zeal, and the economic interests of Western powers. 

Some notable people who advocated or opposed this idea were Theodore Roosevelt, Mark Twain, Mahatma Gandhi, Joseph Conrad, and W.E.B. Du Bois. The white man's burden has been a controversial and influential topic in history, literature, and culture, and its legacy can still be seen in the effects of colonialism, racism, and globalization today.

Joseph Conrad and Rudyard Kipling are two of the most influential writers of the colonial era. Their works, such as Heart of Darkness and The Jungle Book, explore the complex and often violent interactions between the colonizers and the colonized. Both authors use vivid imagery, symbolism, and allegory to portray the effects of imperialism on the human psyche and the natural environment. However, their perspectives and attitudes differ significantly, reflecting their own backgrounds and experiences. Conrad, who was born in Poland and worked as a sailor in Africa, Asia, and South America, was more critical and skeptical of the colonial project. He exposed the hypocrisy, corruption, and brutality of the European powers, and showed how their greed and racism dehumanized both themselves and the natives. Kipling, who was born in India and spent most of his childhood there, was more supportive and optimistic about the colonial project. He celebrated the British Empire as a civilizing force that brought order, culture, and progress to the "dark" and "savage" lands. He also idealized the natives as noble, loyal, and brave, but also childlike, naive, and dependent on the white man's guidance.
