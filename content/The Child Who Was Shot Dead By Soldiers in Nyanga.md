The line "*The child is not dead*" -> is repeated throughout the poem

It symbolizes the **hope** and the resilience of the spirit of the nation, despite the constant killing. 
*The child* is a stand-in for the entire country, for the children in Africa, and for the entire nation of Africa 

The child rises his fist against 
	his mother
	his father

Child is the shadow of the soldiers
Child is present at all meetings, legislations; peeps through windows of houses and into the hearts of mothers
the child who just wanted to play in the sun at Nyanga is everywhere

ends with "Without a pass" -> the child is **free** to go anywhere, doesn't need a pass / permission
