Affect is a term used to describe experience of feeling or emotion.

 It can be understood as a **combination** of three components: **emotion**, **mood** (enduring, less intense emotional states that are not necessarily tied to a specific event), and **affectivity** (an individual's overall disposition or *temperament*)

Dimensions of Affect:
1. Valence
2. Arousal
3. Motivational Intensity

[[Emotions]]: predispositions to a certain type of action in response to a specific stimulus, which produce a cascade of rapid and synchronized physiological and cognitive changes.

Feeling: **not all feelings include emotion**, such as the feeling of knowing. In the context of emotion, subjective representation of emotions. *Emotions are often described as the raw, instinctive responses, while feelings involve our interpretation and awareness of those responses.*

Moods: enduring **affective states** that are considered less intense than emotions and appear to lack a contextual stimulus.

Affect: a broader term used to describe the **emotional and cognitive experience of an emotion, feeling or mood.**
