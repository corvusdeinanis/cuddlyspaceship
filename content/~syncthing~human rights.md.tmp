first class

very messed up examples

not sure what he was getting at.
what he was asking. if he was agreeing or not


> [!CAUTION] Red Flag
> Says that things were better in the past; that he would say what the fuck if someone told him about existence of LGBTQIA+ people. 


> [!caution] Red Flag 2
> said human rights problem is only a contemporary problem!!! When I said I disagree and gave evidence against his scrupulous claim, he said nope. You weren't there. You don't know either b`****`, how old are you? You think queer people did not exist in the past? You think identities and gender and things are shit my generation is hyper-fixated on? Really? 


> [!caution] Red Flag 3
> Fucked up example. REFERRING TO A STUDENT, LOOKING AT HER AND SAYING things like *"I don't know she had all the right things"* or something on those lines. Saying isn't my right important too? What if ten people looking at this felt good, does it mean it's good? 10 vs 1
> then justified it saying "I'm just playing the devil's advocate"
