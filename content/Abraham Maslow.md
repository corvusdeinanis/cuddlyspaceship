famous for his hierarchy of needs theory, which proposes that human motivation is driven by a series of needs that range from basic physiological needs to higher psychological needs such as [[self-actualization]]. 
People seek to satisfy their lower needs before moving on to their higher needs and that only a few people achieve their full potential.
