a generalist health service specialty in professional psychology

alleviate distress 
resolve crises

## Basic Counselling Skills 
-> attending
-> should listen, be attentive
-> rapport building
-> immediacy
-> focusing
-> questions
-> summarizing
-> reflecting and paraphrasing^[(note: personally hate this so much. Is so artificial.)]

>[!NOTE]
in my opinion, 
>- making them feel comfy 
>- affirming while not enabling
>- making them feel heard, not shortcuts like paraphrasing
>- TRANSPARENCY 
>- body language 
>- be a guide, not be an advisor; DON'T SOLVE the problems. Make them self-sufficient 
>Basically, be a sensible, sensitive communicator
