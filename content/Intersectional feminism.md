# Intersectional Feminism
A branch of feminism that recognizes that different forms of oppression and discrimination can intersect and overlap, creating unique and complex experiences for different groups of women. Intersectional feminism aims to include and amplify the voices of women who face multiple forms of marginalization, such as women of color, LGBTQ+ women, disabled women, poor women, etc. Intersectional feminism acknowledges that there is no one universal experience of womanhood, and that different women have different needs and priorities .
