American psychologist 
known for her theory of **mindset**, which refers to the beliefs that people have about their own abilities and potential. She distinguished between two types of mindsets: fixed mindset and growth mindset. People with a fixed mindset believe that their intelligence and talents are fixed and cannot be changed, while people with a growth mindset believe that their intelligence and talents can be developed through effort and learning. She showed that mindset affects various aspects of human behavior, such as motivation, achievement, self-regulation, and resilience.
