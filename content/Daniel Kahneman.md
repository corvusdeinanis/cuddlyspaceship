Israeli-American psychologist
Nobel laureate 
pioneer of behavioral economics and judgment and decision making
He collaborated with Amos Tversky to develop the **prospect theory**, which describes how people make choices under uncertainty and risk. 

- proposed the **dual-process theory of cognition**, which distinguishes between two modes of thinking: System 1 (fast, intuitive, and emotional) and System 2 (slow, deliberate, and rational). He demonstrated that human judgment and decision making are often biased by various heuristics and fallacies that result from the use of System 1.
