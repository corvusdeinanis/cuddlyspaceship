## Bipolar Disorder
Chronic, life-long 
characterized by periods or episodes of extreme mood disturbances (**mania**, **hypomania**, and depression)

### Types 
**Bipolar 1**: This type *involves at least one manic episode that may be severe enough to require hospitalization*. People with Bipolar 1 may also experience major depressive episodes, but it’s not required for the diagnosis.
**Bipolar 2**: This type is characterized *by at least one hypomanic episode and one major depressive episode*. Hypomanic episodes are similar to manic episodes but less severe and without the need for hospitalization. *The depressive episodes in Bipolar 2 tend to be more frequent and longer-lasting than in Bipolar 1*
**Cyclothymia**: This is a milder form of bipolar disorder with chronic fluctuating moods involving numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms. These symptoms are less severe than those of full-blown manic or major depressive episodes. To be diagnosed with Cyclothymia, the symptoms must persist for at least two years in adults.
