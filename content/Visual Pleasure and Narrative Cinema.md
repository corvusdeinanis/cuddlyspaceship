An essay  by [[Laura Mulvey]] which employs psychoanalysis
to analyze the ways of the unconscious of patriarchal society
how that translates to the big screen
her intention is to "destroy pleasure and beauty in the traditional sense" by asking questions
uses [[Psychoanalytic School of Thought]]

1975 

Mulvey argues that mainstream cinema is structured by the male gaze, which objectifies women and positions them as passive spectacles for the pleasure of male viewers. Mulvey also distinguishes between two modes of cinematic pleasure: scopophilia (the pleasure of looking) and identification (the pleasure of relating to the characters). She suggests that women are denied both modes of pleasure in patriarchal cinema, and calls for alternative forms of filmmaking that challenge the dominant ideology and aesthetics.

### Key Points
Phallocentrism
Pleasure is derived from: 
1. [[Scopophilia]] 
	dimming of lights, faux-voyeuristic, how 
2. [[ego libido]]
3. [[castration complex]]

**latent sexism** and how it affects cinema [^1]


women are objects or portrayed that way; they are mere passive participants,
they are props, they slow down the narrative with erotic contemplation (metaphorical but also literal in cases - see slo-mo),
devoid of any actual characteristics
just a vessel, a vehicle for male 
Laura attributes this to women's lack of phallus 

pinups, stripteases, they are **anti-narrative**; 
reduced to powerless, agency-less, objects that are **possessed**

1) **Phallocenterism** 
	penis envy
	castration anxiety 
	castrated woman 
	paradox of phallocentrism - phallus =  center of the world; BUT it depends on the image of a castrated woman to give order and meaning to its world. the burden is on the woman.
	woman is the lynchpin to the system 

2) function of woman in forming patiarchal unconscious is twofold
	 1. she first symbolizes the castration threat by her absence of a real penis
	 2. thereby raises her child into the symbolic
	This does not make it into law and language, but remains in the unconscious and affects 
	
	She can only exist in relation to castration and cannot transcend it. 

	a woman = siginifier of the male other; 
	bound by a symbolic order in which man can live out his fantasies and obsessions through linguistic command by imposing them (!e) 
	bearer of meaning, not maker of meaning

psychoanalysis brings feminists nearer to the roots of their oppression

### Destruction of Pleasure as a Radical Weapon

cinema poses questions of ways  (!e)



cinema **normalizes**
