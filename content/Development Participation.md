Participation is a key aspect in development.

Development is not possible without **willing** participation of the people. 

**PDC** or Participatory Development Communication is an approach in which 

**Horizontal Communication** -> Everyone is equal, no hierarchy; policy makers  to grass root workers, all are equal. 

Emphasis 

## Process of PDC at a Community Level
**Step 1**
Understanding ground realities and establish relationship
**Step 2**
Involving community in identification of the problems
**Step 3**
Identifying community groups, opinion leaders, and other stakeholders
**Step 4**
Identifying communication needs, objectives and activities
**Step 5**
Identifying appropriate communication tools


> [!NOTE] Note
> Structure is not rigid, order is not rigid.

## Preconditions for PDC to Work
1) Motivation and Aspiration of community members
2) Availability of resources required
3) Presence of community leaders who can contribute as opinion leaders

## Principles of PDC Approach
- **Change must come from within**, not externally imposed
- Development Communicators should be closely connected to the community
- Objectiv is to **IDENTIFY**, not **DICTATE**
- Not a means to an end, in some cases the goal itself
