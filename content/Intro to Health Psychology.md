> health psychology examines the **psychological** and **social** factors that *lead* to the *enhancement* of health, the *prevention* and *treatment* of illness, and the *evaluation* and *modiﬁcation* of **health policies** that inﬂuence health care

A field devoted to **understanding psychological inﬂuences** on *how* people stay healthy, *why* they become ill, and *how they respond* when they do get ill.
Health and illness is studied so that health psychologists can develop *interventions*. Analyze, improve and formulate health policy

## What is "health"?

    -   World Health Organization (1948)

it is a ***balance*** among physical, mental, and social well-being

**wellness** = usually means optimum state of health 

## What do health psychologists do?
- Study the interconnection between social, psychological and biological factors that contribute to an illness
- Why do some people get sick more often; why do some people recover faster;
-  focus on health promotion and maintenance
- study the **etiology** and **correlates** of an illness
- develop *interventions*
- examine psychologic and social factors 

## Why did it arise?
[[Mind Body Problem]]

In the **pre-historic** times, most cultures did not separate mind and body. Therefore, **disease** was viewed as work of evil spirits. Skulls from the Stone Age 

trephining -> humour theory (four humors) -> bloodletting and trephining again -> prayers and priests -> renaissance -> **BIOMEDICAL** model -> [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theories + modern psychology gave way to **BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL** model

|**Model**|**Focus**|**Assumptions**|
|---|---|---|
