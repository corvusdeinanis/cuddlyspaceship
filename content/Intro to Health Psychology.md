# What is Health Psychology?

> health psychology examines the **psychological** and **social** factors that *lead* to the *enhancement* of health, the *prevention* and *treatment* of illness, and the *evaluation* and *modiﬁcation* of **health policies** that inﬂuence health care

A field devoted to **understanding psychological inﬂuences** on *how* people stay healthy, *why* they become ill, and *how they respond* when they do get ill.
Health and illness is studied so that health psychologists can develop *interventions*. Analyze, improve and formulate health policy

## What is "health"?

> a *complete* state of physical, mental, and social *well-being* and **not** *merely the absence* of *disease* or infirmity
    -   World Health Organization (1948)

it is a ***balance*** among physical, mental, and social well-being
(more in [[Health]])

**wellness** = usually means optimum state of health 

## What do health psychologists do?
- Study the *interconnection between social, psychological and biological factors* that contribute to an illness
- Why do some people get sick more often; why do some people recover faster;
-  focus on *health promotion* and *maintenance*
- study the **etiology**^[[[General Glossary]]] and **correlates** of an illness
- develop *interventions*
- examine psychologic and social factors that influence health

## [[Goals of Health Psychology]]

## Why did it arise?

In the **pre-historic** times, most cultures did not separate mind and body. Therefore, **disease** was viewed as work of evil spirits. Skulls from the Stone Age ^[see also: [[Mind Body Problem]]]

trephining -> humour theory (four humors) -> bloodletting and trephining again -> prayers and priests -> renaissance -> **BIOMEDICAL** model -> [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theories + modern psychology gave way to **BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL** model

|**Model**|**Focus**|**Assumptions**|
|---|---|---|
|***Biomedical***|Physical aspects of disease|Disease is caused by biological factors|
|***Biopsychosocial***|Biological, psychological, and social factors|Disease is caused by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors|
