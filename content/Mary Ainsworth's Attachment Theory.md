### Strange Situation Assessment
a researcher observes a child's reactions when a mother briefly leaves her child alone in an unfamiliar room. The way the baby reacts in presence of a stranger can tell us about the attachment style 

### Attachment Styles
Secure attachment: Securely attached children seek comfort when frightened and prefer parents to strangers.
Insecure-avoidant attachment: Anxiously attached children are wary of strangers, exhibit great distress when a parent leaves, but are not comforted by a parent's return. 
Insecure-resistant attachment: Avoidantly attached children show little preference for parents over strangers and seek little comfort from their caregivers.
