TV broadcasting technologies are the methods of transmitting and receiving television signals over a distance. There are different types of TV broadcasting technologies, such as cable, satellite, terrestrial, and internet. Here are some brief descriptions of each type:

- **Terrestrial TV** aka **over-the-air television**Â (OTA): This is a system that uses radio waves to transmit TV signals from a transmitter to an antenna. Terrestrial TV can be either analog or digital, and it is the most common and widely available type of TV broadcasting. It requires an antenna and a tuner to access it.
- **Cable TV**: This is a system that uses coaxial cables to deliver TV signals to a specific location. Cable TV offers a variety of channels, services, and packages. It requires a cable connection and a set-top box to access it.
- **Satellite TV**: This is a system that uses satellites in geostationary orbit to broadcast TV signals to a large area. Satellite TV can be either analog or digital, and it offers high-quality picture and sound. It requires a satellite dish and a receiver to access it.
- **Internet TV**: This is a system that uses the internet to stream or download TV content to various devices, such as computers, smartphones, tablets, and smart TVs.
