## Attribution Theory 
by Fritz Heider

how humans attempt to make sense of behaviour 
how we infer or come to conclusions
causal judgment

>“Attribution theory deals with how the social perceiver uses information to arrive at causal explanations for events. It examines what information is gathered and how it is combined to form a causal judgment”
> -- Fiske and Taylor

### Dispositional
Dispositional attribution assigns the cause of behavior to some
internal characteristic of a person rather than to outside forces.
### Situational
The process of assigning the cause of behavior to some situation or event outside a person’s control rather than to some internal characteristic

## Actor-Observer Bias


## Fundamental Attribution Theory
 a person's tendency to attribute another's actions to their character or personality or internal circumstances rather than external factors such as the environment while attributing their own behavior to external factors

## Self-serving Bias
attribute good things to internal and bad things to external
to protect self-esteem
