## Relevance of implementing laws for the smooth functioning of the nation. 

Rohan P, 21BAR01080, OPJ B

What are "laws"?
Laws are a form of social control. Along with mores, they form the major form of social control. They are upheld by social institutions and are woven throughout our lives, affecting every facet. 

Laws are body of rules and regulations that are **enforced** or **imposed**. They are imposed by an authority body like a government. In theory, laws are for ensuring peace, egalitarianism, and keeping up the social cohesion. The function of law is to ensure the welfare of people. Laws are made on the premise that it helps to run society. People who disobey laws are treated with consequences and are usually punished (though, in most cases, rehabilitation would be a better option). 

Laws are as old as human culture
Laws have evolved but have been present throughout History. We have unearthed ancient rock edicts, scriptures, inscriptions, etc. All of this prove that laws have been ever present in human history. 

Why do we need social control? 
We need social control for social cohesion, for moralistic reasons, to deter behaviour that would not benefit society at large. It is to make human behaviour "acceptable". Religion and mores have been important forms of social control imparting moral values. 

Without an authoritative body imposing laws, many people believe that society would fall apart and that law is the glue that holds society together. This is untrue because there have been various examples in History. For example, Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES) formerly called Rojava (There is not forceful implementation of law, there is no death penalty, there is focus on care and rehabilitation) or the Zaptistas.

Why we need to focus on implementation of laws? 
Laws, even the ones that are great on paper, are useless unless they are implemented widely. Implementing and enforcing laws is what makes them **compulsory**. 

- We need to focus on equal implementation of laws. There must be equity.
- Laws must be enforced uniformly.

To put it shortly, laws are guidelines that are prescribed and imposed by authority for the welfare of everyone. This does not always translate to real life well because not all laws are fair and not all of them are implemented well or more often, they are implemented unfairly. The rich and powerful are unscathed while the poor and vulnerable are subject to harsher punishments

It is as important to implement laws fairly as it is to make them.
