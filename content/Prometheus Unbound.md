A lyrical drama by Percy Bysshe Shelley, inspired by the ancient Greek myth of Prometheus, who defies the gods and gives fire to humanity. The play depicts Prometheus's suffering under the tyranny of Zeus, who chains him to a rock and sends an eagle to devour his liver every day. Prometheus is eventually freed by the Demogorgon, a mysterious power that overthrows Zeus and ushers in a new era of harmony and equality among gods, humans, and nature. The play is a reflection of Shelley's political and philosophical views, which advocate for rebellion against oppression and for the power of love and imagination.
