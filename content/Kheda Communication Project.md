KCP was a pioneering field laboratory (1975-1990) in Kheda district, Gujarat, aiming to develop local communication and education through television.

Community Engagement: It featured local production of development and educational programs, involving villagers as actors and writers, addressing issues like caste discrimination and family planning.

Technological Integration: The project utilized a low-power transmitter and community television sets in villages, broadcasting both local and national programs, and was recognized for its rural communication efficiency with the UNESCO Prize in 1984.

Government Support & Challenges: Despite its success and political autonomy, the KCP model was not replicated elsewhere in India, and the government eventually shifted focus to urban audiences for financial reasons
