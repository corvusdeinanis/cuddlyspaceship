### Principles of Writing for Radio
conversational
brief and contain only one idea
simple and direct
correct grammar
important information first
Stick to short sentences

Use the active voice and active verbs
write with visual imagery. Make your listeners “see” 
Titles precede names
age reference, precede the name with the age
Avoid writing direct quotations into a news script, if at all possible

attribution should come before a quotation, not after it

Round off numbers unless the exact number is significant
Do not split a sentence between pages
