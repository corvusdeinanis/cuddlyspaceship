Things Fall Apart is a novel by Chinua Achebe, published in 1958. It tells the story of Okonkwo, a leader and warrior of the Igbo people of Nigeria, in the late 19th century. Okonkwo is a proud and ambitious man who strives to overcome the legacy of his weak and lazy father. He is respected in his clan for his achievements in wrestling, farming, and warfare. He has three wives and several children, but he is especially fond of his daughter Ezinma and his adopted son Ikemefuna.

The novel depicts the culture and traditions of the Igbo people before and after the arrival of European missionaries and colonial administrators. It shows how Okonkwo and his clan struggle to maintain their identity and values in the face of external changes and challenges. Okonkwo's life is marked by several tragic events, such as the death of Ikemefuna, who is killed by the clan as a sacrifice to appease the gods; the accidental killing of a clansman by Okonkwo, which forces him to go into exile for seven years; and the conversion of his son Nwoye to Christianity, which causes a rift between them.

The novel ends with Okonkwo's suicide, after he kills a messenger sent by the British to stop a meeting of the clan elders. Okonkwo's death is seen as a disgrace by both his clan and the British, who regard him as a savage and a troublemaker. His body is buried by the Christian converts, who are the only ones willing to touch it.

Chinua Achebe was a Nigerian writer and professor, widely regarded as one of the most influential African authors of the 20th century. He was born in 1930 in Ogidi, a town in southeastern Nigeria that was part of the British colony at the time. He grew up in a Christian family, but was also exposed to the Igbo culture and language of his ancestors. He attended missionary schools and later studied English literature at the University of Ibadan. He worked as a teacher, broadcaster, and editor before becoming a full-time writer.

Achebe wrote Things Fall Apart as a response to the negative portrayal of Africa and its people by European writers, such as Joseph Conrad and Rudyard Kipling. He wanted to show the richness and complexity of African history and culture, as well as the impact of colonialism on African societies. He also wanted to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that many Europeans had about Africans, such as their supposed lack of civilization, religion, and morality.

Achebe's novel was an immediate success, both in Africa and abroad. It has been translated into more than 50 languages and has sold over 20 million copies worldwide. It is considered a classic of world literature and a masterpiece of African literature. It has inspired many other writers, such as Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Wole Soyinka, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and Chinelo Okparanta. It has also been adapted into several films, plays, operas, and musicals.
