Communication is a two-way process where information is exchanged or passed from one person to another person. The word is derived from 'communicare' which means to impart.

Communication has various functions. Some important ones are -  
a) Educate - Communication can be used to help educate people, teach them new concepts and ideas.

b) Inform - Communication can be used to alert people, to inform them of events, news, etc. For e.g. - There's a car crash. The onlookers call the ambulance and inform what has happened.

c) Clear Misconceptions - Communication can be used to clear misconceptions, most of which arise due to improper communication or a total lack of it.  
d) Spread Awareness - Can be used to spread awareness and make sure people know current happenings. For e.g. - Government spreading awareness of  the benefits of vaccination

e) Persuade - Can be used to persuade people to do or not do something. It helps make take action.

f) Propagate

j) Create opinion - Communication can raise questions and generate opinion and discourse on various topics.

h) Exchange views - Communication can be used to exchange views, ideas, and have discourses.

Barriers of communication are obstacles that do not let us communicate effectively, they hamper our ability to exchange information. There are many types of barriers of communication.

-   Physical Barriers -  Just like the name suggests, these barriers are physical in nature. They can be as simple as a wall seperating two people to barriers due to distance
-   Psychological Barriers - Barriers that arise due to our cognition, or mental states. They include our emotions, moods, opinions, attitude, attention, etc. For eg- When someone is angry, they might interpret others' behaviour in a negative tone.
-   Semantic Barriers - These are barriers that arise due to use of language. Words being misunderstood or misconstrued, figures of speech interpreted wrongly, and homophones/homonyms, can all be causes of this barrier.
-   Environmental Barriers
-   Linguistic Barriers - Barriers that arise due to difference in languages, or due to the lack of ability of being able to understand a different language. This can lead to everything from no communication to miscommunication (mistranslation).
-   Cultural Differences - All cultures are different. What is considered to be "proper" in a culture might be considered "improper" in a different one. Also, culture dictates a large part of our life. Therefore, differences in culture can act as barriers.
