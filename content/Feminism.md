# Feminism

A social and political movement that advocates for the equality of all genders in all aspects of life, such as education, work, health, rights, and representation. Feminism challenges the systems and structures that oppress and discriminate against women and other marginalized genders, such as patriarchy, sexism, misogyny, and [[gender]] stereotypes. Feminism also celebrates the diversity and achievements of women and their contributions to society .
