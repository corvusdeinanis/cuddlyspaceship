Changing level of support over the course of  a teaching session

> _n._ in education, a teaching style that supports and facilitates the student as they learn a new skill or concept, with the ultimate goal of the student becoming self-reliant. Derived from [[Vygotsky's Sociocultural Cognitive Method|Lev Vygotskyâ€™s theories]], in practice it involves teaching material just beyond the level at which the student could learn alone. Technologies (e.g., computer software) that may be used to assist in this process are known as scaffolded tools.
