### Basic Counselling Skills 
(Apparently)
-> attending
-> should listen, be attentive
-> rapport building
-> immediacy
-> focusing
-> questions
-> summarizing
-> reflecting and paraphrasing (note: personally hate this so much. Is so artificial.)

in my opinion, 
- making them feel comfy 
- affirming while not enabling
- making them feel heard, not shortcuts like paraphrasing
- TRANSPARENCY 
- body language 
- be a guide, not be an advisor; DON'T SOLVE the problems. Make them self-sufficient 

Basically, be a sensible, sensitive communicator 

### Guidance vs Counselling 
(imo, it should be a )

### Counsellor vs Therapist
|Counsellor|Therapist|
|---|---|
|Short term, focused on solving a situation| Long term, clincal. Making the individual self sufficient, ensure they can stand on their own|
