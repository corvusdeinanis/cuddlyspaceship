A psychological phenomenon that occurs when a person holds two or more contradictory beliefs, values, or attitudes, or when their actions are inconsistent with their beliefs. 

This causes mental discomfort or stress, which motivates the person to reduce the dissonance by changing their beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors, or by [[Ego Defense Mechanisms|rationalization]] or justifying them. 

Cognitive dissonance can affect various aspects of human behavior and decision making, such as attitude change, persuasion, conformity, self-justification, and [[cognitive bias]]

*[[Festinger & Carlsmith (1959)]]*


In [[Elliot Aronson]]'s _Theories of Cognitive Consistency_ (1973), he states: "Dissonance theory does not rest upon the assumption that man is a rational animal; rather, it suggests that man is a rationalizing animal â€“ that he attempts to appear rational, both to others and to himself."
