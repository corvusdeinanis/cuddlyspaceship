The mind–body problem is a debate concerning the relationship between thought and [[consciousness]] in the human mind, and the [[brain]] as part of the physical body.

Mind = not physical
Body = physical 

how do they interact?

How can "meat you can eat"[^1] produce subjective experiences?

*Then I thought, Hold on, there’s a paradox here. Science is a method for eliminating subjectivity from our perceptions so we see things as they really are, we achieve objectivity, which philosopher Thomas Nagel calls “the view from nowhere.” But the mind-body problem is different from other scientific problems, because subjectivity is part of the problem. Subjectivity, you might say, is the problem. Maybe we cannot escape our subjectivity when we contemplate consciousness and other mind-related riddles. When it comes to the mind-body problem, maybe there is no view from nowhere.* - [The Mind Body Problem](https://www.mindbodyproblems.com/), John Horgan
