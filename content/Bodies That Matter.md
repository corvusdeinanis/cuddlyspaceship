by [[Judith Butler]] 

influenced by [[Michel Foucault]] 


 **gender is performative, meaning that it is maintained, created or perpetuated by iterative repetitions when speaking and interacting with each other**

performative, not performance. that means we can't really change it as freely 

It explores how sex and gender are *constructed* and *regulated* by **power**, **knowledge**, and **discourse**. Some key points are:

- Butler *challenges the concept of sex as a natural and fixed category*. She argues that sex is a social construct that is shaped by power and norms, and that it has effects on how bodies are classified and regulated.
- Butler examines how different forms of power operate in different historical periods and social contexts. Foucault identifies three main modes of power: sovereign power, disciplinary power, and biopower.
- Butler analyzes how power creates different types of knowledge and discourse, which are ways of speaking and thinking about reality. She shows how knowledge and discourse are not neutral or objective, but are influenced by power relations and interests.
- Butler explores how power affects the formation of subjectivity, which is the sense of self and identity. She argues that subjectivity is not fixed or innate, but is constructed and transformed by power, knowledge, and discourse.
- Butler calls for a feminist transformation of society, which would challenge compulsory heterosexuality and create more possibilities for women’s lives. She urges women to question their sexual assumptions and choices, and to support each other in their struggles for liberation.

Butler makes two different claims in the passage cited: that sex is a social construction, and that sex is gender. To unpack their view, consider the two claims in turn. First, the idea that sex is a social construct, for Butler, boils down to the view that our sexed bodies are also performative and, so, they have “no ontological status apart from the various acts which constitute [their] reality”
