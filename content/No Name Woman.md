A part of [[The Woman Warrior]], by [[Maxine Hong Kingston]]
A memoir where Maxine tries to discover herself, her roots, and reconcile with her identity of being American 

 Narrated by the author's mother about her husband's sister (the author's aunt)

No Name Woman -> The aunt of the author; her father's sister 

Author's mother tells about the aunt; WARNING her not to talk about this. 

### Summary 

Setting - Chinese village

Kingston's aunt gave birth to an **illegitimate child** -> the village mob **ransacked** the family's house, killed all their livestock, destroyed all the crops
No Name Woman went to the pigsty to give birth
Brave Orchid found the NNW and her baby dead in the well; NNW had killed herself, suicide. 

It is meant to be a cautionary tale 
"Now that you've started to menstruate, what happened to her could happen to you. Don't humiliate us... The villagers are watchful"

Author struggles to understand how the aunt's history will help her conduct herself properly. She goes and asks Chinese Americans

### Analysis
Her American sensibilities do not reconcile with the Chinese context 

Kingston rewrites the story from her own perspective (American-influenced)
She tries to guess the reasons for her aunt's actions

With her rewriting of the talk-story, she reconciles her Chinese past and her American present

A continuinty is established; Brave Orchid represents cultural traditions of China, and Maxine represents the identity of a first-generation Chinese American 
### Characters

### Quotes
"The village had also been counting. On the night the baby was to be born the villagers raided our house"
"The village had also been counting. On the night the baby was to be born the villagers raided our house"
"The villagers broke in the front and the back doors at the same time, even though we had not locked the doors against them. Their knives 
dripped with the blood of our animals. They smeared blood on the doors and walls. One woman swung a chicken, whose throat she had slit, 
splattering blood in red arcs about her."
"When they left, they took sugar and oranges to bless themselves. They cut pieces from the dead animals. Some of them took bowls that 
were not broken and clothes that were not torn"

Those of us in the first American generations have had to figure out how the invisible world the emigrants built around our childhoods fits in solid America

My aunt could not have been the lone romantic who gave up everything for sex. 
Women in the old China did not choose. Some man had commanded her to lie with him and be his secret evil. I wonder whether he masked 
himself when he joined the raid on her family.

The other man was not, after all, much different from her husband. They both gave orders: she followed. "If you tell your family, I'll beat 
you. I'll kill you. Be here again next week." 

In a commensal tradition, where food is precious, the powerful older people made wrongdoers 
eat alone. Instead of letting them start separate new lives like the Japanese, who could become samurais and geishas, the Chinese family, 
faces averted but eyes glowering sideways, hung on to the offenders and fed them leftovers. My aunt must have lived in the same house as 
my parents and eaten at an outcast table. 

Once my aunt found a freckle on her chin, at a spot that the almanac said predestined her for unhappiness. She dug it out with a hot needle 
and washed the wound with peroxide

Adultery, perhaps only a mistake during good times, became a crime when the 
village needed food.

But there is more to this silence: they want me to participate in her punishment. And I have.

The real punishment was not the raid swiftly inflicted by 
the villagers, but the family's deliberately forgetting her
