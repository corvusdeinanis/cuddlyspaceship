Report 
Introduction

Aakrithi’s Counseling & Academy under Ranjini Jois, a mental health practitioner with 30+ years of experience. She practises Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and mindfulness techniques. She incorporates parts of zen

Aakrithis Counselling & Academy is known for offering mental health services like therapy and
counselling. The academy offers services such as relationship counselling, premarital treatment,
behavioural therapy, solutions for pre- and post-teen issues, and de-addiction therapy. They offer
a variety of psychological treatments, such as group therapy, spouse counselling, and adolescent
and psychological therapy. They give students the chance to gain real-world work experience,
bridging the knowledge gap between academic theory and workplace realities. Their mission is
to offer their clients high-quality counselling services while assisting them on their path to an
upbeat and friendly existence. Through ongoing research in the areas of psychology and
cognitive functioning, the Academy envisions a society free of myths and taboos concerning the
instinctual health world, which is prone to accept life as it is.

Description of Work
Worked as a trainee counsellor at the clinic along with six other trainee counsellors.

Learning theory and techniques: Trainee counsellors spend a significant amount of time studying various counselling theories, models, and techniques.

Observing and shadowing experienced counsellors: Trainee counsellors often have the opportunity to observe and shadow experienced counsellors in real counselling sessions. This allows them to gain firsthand experience and learn how to apply counselling techniques in practice.

Developing counselling skills: Trainee counsellors work on developing their counselling skills, such as active listening, empathy, rapport-building, and effective communication. They may practise these skills through role-plays, mock counselling sessions, or supervised counselling sessions with clients.

Conducting assessments: Under supervision, trainee counsellors may be involved in conducting client assessments. This involves gathering information about the client's background, history, concerns, and goals to better understand their needs and develop appropriate treatment plans.

Attending training and supervision sessions: Trainee counsellors participate in regular training and supervision sessions where they discuss their cases, receive feedback on their counselling techniques, and learn from the expertise of their supervisors. These sessions are crucial for their professional development and growth.

Understanding ethical guidelines: Trainee counsellors are expected to adhere to ethical guidelines and professional standards of practice. They must maintain client confidentiality, respect boundaries, and ensure the well-being of their clients.

Case Discussions
Case discussion is a vital component of various educational and professional settings, particularly in fields like medicine, law, business, and academia. It refers to a collaborative and interactive process where individuals analyse and explore real or hypothetical scenarios, often involving complex problems or decision-making dilemmas.
During a case discussion, participants are presented with a specific case study or scenario that encapsulates key details and pertinent information. The primary objective is to foster critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and analytical reasoning by engaging in a structured conversation. Participants are encouraged to examine the case from multiple perspectives, offer insights, share experiences, and propose potential solutions or strategies.
Case discussions provide a platform for individuals to enhance their knowledge, develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter, and refine their decision-making abilities. The process encourages active participation, stimulates intellectual curiosity, and promotes the exchange of diverse viewpoints. By exploring different angles, participants gain exposure to varied strategies and approaches, which can broaden their own problem-solving repertoire.
Furthermore, case discussions facilitate the development of essential skills such as effective communication, active listening, and the ability to articulate and defend one's viewpoint. Participants learn to engage in respectful debates, challenge assumptions, and consider alternative perspectives, leading to a richer and more comprehensive exploration of the case.
Overall, case discussions serve as a valuable learning tool, fostering a collaborative environment where individuals can engage in rigorous analysis, learn from each other's experiences, and collectively develop a deeper understanding of complex problems.
Formal Diagnosis
Formal diagnosis in psychology refers to the process of identifying and categorising mental health disorders based on established criteria and guidelines. It involves the use of standardised assessment tools and diagnostic manuals to determine if an individual meets the criteria for a specific psychological disorder.
The process of formal diagnosis typically involves several steps. First, the clinician gathers information through interviews, observation, and psychological tests. This information helps to assess the individual's symptoms, history, and functioning in various areas of life. Next, the clinician compares the collected information to the diagnostic criteria outlined in the DSM or other relevant diagnostic manuals.
To make a formal diagnosis, the clinician must determine if the individual's symptoms align with the specific criteria for a particular disorder. They consider the duration, intensity, and impact of the symptoms on the individual's daily life. Additionally, they rule out other possible explanations for the symptoms, such as medical conditions or substance abuse.
Formal diagnosis in psychology provides a standardised language and framework for understanding and communicating about mental health conditions. It helps in developing personalised treatment plans, facilitating research, and ensuring consistency and accuracy in the field of psychology.

Learning methods / breathing techniques
Breathing methods play a crucial role in various therapeutic approaches and can significantly contribute to overall well-being. These techniques focus on the conscious control and regulation of breath, which can have a profound impact on physical, mental, and emotional states.
One commonly used breathing method in therapy is diaphragmatic breathing, also known as belly breathing. It involves deep inhalation, where the diaphragm, a dome-shaped muscle located below the lungs, expands, and the abdomen rises. This technique promotes relaxation, reduces stress, and helps in managing anxiety and panic disorders.
Another beneficial breathing method is paced breathing, which involves breathing at a specific rhythm or pace. This technique often utilises the 4-7-8 breathing pattern, where one breathes in for a count of 4, holds the breath for a count of 7, and exhales slowly for a count of 8. Paced breathing can induce a calming effect, regulate heart rate, and alleviate symptoms of anxiety and stress.
Furthermore, alternate nostril breathing, a yogic breathing technique, involves inhaling and exhaling through one nostril at a time while closing the other nostril with a finger. This practice is believed to balance energy, improve focus, and promote a sense of calm.
Breathing methods in therapy work by activating the parasympathetic nervous system, which counteracts the "fight-or-flight" response and promotes relaxation. These techniques can be integrated into various therapeutic modalities, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based therapies, and stress management programs.
By incorporating breathing methods into therapy, individuals can develop effective self-regulation skills, enhance their ability to manage emotions, reduce physical tension, and cultivate a greater sense of overall well-being. These techniques are accessible, practical, and can be utilised outside of therapy sessions, making them valuable tools for self-care and stress reduction.

Key Outcomes and Impacts
Better understanding of mental health landscape
During my psychology internship, I was able to gain a better understanding of the mental health landscape. I learned about different mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I also learned about different treatment modalities, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy and psychodynamic therapy. One of the most valuable things about my internship was the opportunity to work with clients and see how different interventions can help them. I was also able to learn from experienced professionals and get a sense of what it's like to work in the field of psychology. Overall, my internship was an incredibly valuable experience that helped me to grow both personally and professionally.
Better at conversations and relations in day-to-day life
Learning therapy skills has been incredibly helpful in real life conversations. One of the most important skills that I've learned is active listening. This involves really paying attention to what the other person is saying, and making sure that I understand their perspective. I've found that this skill has been really helpful in my personal relationships, because it allows me to be more present and engaged in conversations.

Another skill that I've learned is how to communicate more effectively. This involves being clear and direct in my communication, while also being empathetic and understanding. I've found that this skill has been particularly helpful in my work life, where I need to communicate with colleagues and clients on a regular basis. I think that learning therapy skills can be incredibly valuable in real life conversations. Whether you're talking to a friend, a family member, or a colleague, these skills can help you to communicate more effectively and build stronger relationships.

Therapist-Client Dynamics
It is crucial to understand the dynamics and the relationship shared between a therapist and their client. I learnt the importance of confidentiality, accountability, resourcefulness and also the extent of my abilities. Therapists are required to not give advice but help their client in their journey. It made me better understand the role of the therapist in one’s mental health journey.

It taught me about boundaries and how to draw them effectively and politely.

Deeper Insight on the Human Mind
Therapy helps us identify and treat various psychological disorders, such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, autism, and dementia. By studying the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of these conditions, we can help people who suffer from mental health problems as well as those close to them. We gain a richer understanding of the human mind

Key learnings and Conclusion
Better understanding of disorders, and behavioural issues
We were able to apply the theories and concepts we learned in the classroom to real-life situations. We could also observe how different disorders and behavioural issues affect people’s thoughts, feelings, and actions, and how they can be treated or managed.

We saw different kinds of clients with different ailments and issues.

Some of the cases we studied are elaborated on below. Names have been fictionalised to help protect the identity of the people. The cases have been reproduced after permission from the respective clients.

Case 1

We had the opportunity to be part of an ongoing case where we met Amoolya.
Amoolya is a 23-year-old woman who is good in academics but takes impulsive decisions and changes them quickly. She has had confusion selecting a path, and has experienced many job and stream changes. Amoolya compares herself to others and is too critical of herself.
Amoolya's mother takes therapy for depression, but her father is a bit aggressive. She has had unstable relationships where almost everyone has taken advantage of her. Amoolya has been diagnosed with a behavioural disorder, specifically narcissistic personality disorder.

Amoolya has developed an interest in going through the garbage and throwing it inside and outside her house, which has led to complaints from the neighbours and garbage pickers for destroying the property. She would go through the garbage of her neighbours.

Currently, Amoolya is doing MBA in distance education and takes tuition for kids in 6th grade. However, she constantly has a loss of interest in doing things but gains it back.


Case 2
In this case, we were introduced to Rahul, a thirteen year old. Rahul had a good academic record until fourth grade, after which his grades started to fall. His mother was a homemaker while his dad was a businessman. His mother had always been very critical when it came to Rahul’s studies. He was shouted at and had a considerable amount of pressure to perform well.
Soon, he started to rebel when he was not allowed to go out to play with his friends or was questioned / asked to study. He ran away from home twice according to his parents.

During the covid pandemic, he was restricted to his house like most other people. During this time, he got addicted to the Internet and computers. He would spend all his time on the web. His sleep had become very erratic, his diet largely consisted of junk food and multiple servings of energy drinks and sodas. His lifestyle had become very unhealthy. Add to that, he was mostly sedentary and did not do chores or any work. He had begun skipping school. He apparently made money online and had convinced his friends and family that he was caught in the “dark web” and that it was hard for him to get out. He told them that he was caught in the illicit trade of firearms. Soon, he started using this as a badge of honor. We were told that most of his apartment, his friends, his relatives, and the school were aware of this “situation”.

He was also verbally and physically abusive to his parents. His prognosis got better as he was weaned off the computer and shifted to a residential school. Previous to that, he had tried running away too.

These two were some of our most notable cases. We worked on multiple others, bringing the total count to 14 cases. A brief of all the cases we worked on:

Case 3
Age 10
Lives with mother, father and a sibling. Later known Uncle is also present.
Has seen many psychiatrists. Unhygienic, wounds and bruises in the body.
Complaints of seeing ghosts in the house at night and after coming from school. It was
later found that the uncle sexually assaults the child while the parents are sleeping

Case 4
Age 26
Referred by his sister. Prevented him from committing suicide.
Good childhood until my grandmother passed away. Was attached. Interests reduced after
and became reserved.
During covid started gambling, which increased later led to a huge money loss. Money
was borrowed from relatives who started pressurising him.
Manifestation strategy was introduced to him which helped him to gain back and return
the amount he lost within 3 months

Case 5
Age 36
Childhood wasn't fortunate. Has a sister. Father had two affairs. They did not divorce but
separated. The siblings were separated. His sister lived with his mother while he had to
live with his uncle. They meet on weekends.
He was given shock therapy twice when he got caught masturbating by his mother. He
was humiliated by this.
Once when lightning struck he felt as if it went inside him which made him powerful.
This can be related back to the shock therapies he had been given.
He was diagnosed with tics first even though he doesn’t have it but behaved in such a
way. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia later.

Case 6
Age 24.
Worked at the PVR.
Father was not present. Mother owned a small grocery shop.
He used the money from the theatre and started gambling with it. When the owner found
out about it he reduced his salary. He had lost almost 7 lakhs while gambling.
When the owner started threatening to get the money back he started working more shifts
and even sold properties. He wanted to earn more and help his mother. He was
recommended happiness programs.

Case 7
She was married for 25 years. Son is now 20 years old, earns well and dealing with obesity.
The husband ran away with his colleague who was half his age but sends them some
money each month. Their relatives pressured them on getting a divorce but she waited.
Now the husband has returned to the wife after getting kicked out. Son avoids him. The
husband sleeps in a separate room and they both have separate lives

Case 8
Couple
His elder brother passed away when he was in his undergraduate. The brother was more
of the sweetheart of the family. After his death, he tried to fill that gap and be more like
his brother than himself.
His first marriage was a love marriage. The girl felt uncomfortable living in the house as
he was attached to his mother. He did not have an opinion of his own. The family was
also very conservative. She wanted to move out to a house other than his parents but he
did not agree to that. He did not want to stay away from his parents. They got divorced.
After this, he decided to move to another state for his work. He got into a relationship
with another girl which he soon broke off when his parents decided to get him married to
a girl who was just 18 years old.
The girl’s mother had a bad childhood. Her mother was very insecure as her father had
gotten married to another woman while her mother was still present. She herself was
betrayed by her first husband. Her second husband turned out to be abusive. She got
pregnant with the girl who was then taken by her husband to live with him when she got
older. Finally, the girl put her foot down and came back to live with her mother.
She had good academics and had earned well. Her marriage was good until she got
pregnant with her first child. She was denied food as in the house they only made very
little food. She did not like that her husband did not have an opinion of his own.
She asked her mother to shift to their house which annoyed the husband as they weren’t
in good terms

Case 9
He works in a bank. He makes hurried decisions. He thought he couldn't cope with
anything and was stressed which led him to resign from his job. Covid had
just begun which put him in a financial crisis. He went back to the company who were
reluctant to take him back. He has had suicidal tendencies.

Case 10
Her mother is diagnosed with schizophrenia and has delusions of grandeur, persecution
and erotomania. She was divorced by her husband.
The grandmother is very critical and shouts at the mother which affects the child. The
mother wasn’t much involved in bringing up the child till she was 3 years old. That’s
when her mother started getting involved. This irritated the grandmother.
The child was pampered. She started abusing and being hostile towards her mother when
she turned 8. However, she was good in school. Her mom got her admitted to many
psychiatric hospitals and medications. They separated themselves from her grandparents.
The dad is not much involved in her life. He meets her just for the legal formality.

Case 11
She had issues with her relationship and was scared of moving abroad. She feared how
this would affect her relationship.
Her partner was dominating and did not reciprocate much.
After losing her job she returns back to India. She found out that the guy got married but
she assures her that they will still have a relationship. He asks her to not ask any
questions and not to expect any time from him as he is married now. He would come to
her only when he has time were his demands.
She is now pursuing her interest in photography and distanced herself from him

Case 12
He has problems with speech and motor abilities. The podiatrist recommended him to a
speech therapist and a physiotherapist. He likes listening to music hence music therapy
was done. This improved his abilities.
The mother was poorly treated in her husband’s house. The husband was also distant.
While she was pregnant husband used to abuse her physically and with words. She was
kicked out of the house. It was a cesarean birth. She was kicked out again after his birth.
She tried to hang herself which was seen by the infant. He started crying at the top of his
voice and suddenly lost consciousness. This might’ve been his response to a distressing
event which disrupted his ability to communicate


Professional Implications

I would say that an internship in counseling therapy is a great opportunity for anyone who's interested in pursuing a career in mental health. As someone who's passionate about helping others and supporting people through difficult times, I found that working with a diverse range of clients during my internship was incredibly rewarding.

Of course, it's important to note that an internship in counseling therapy can also be challenging. I worked with clients who were dealing with a wide range of issues, and it could be emotionally taxing at times. However, having a strong support system in place and practicing self-care helped me manage the stress and avoid burnout. I think an internship in counseling therapy is a valuable experience that can help you develop the skills you need to be an effective therapist. If you're interested in pursuing an internship, I would encourage you to reach out to local mental health clinics or private practices to see if they have any opportunities available

In my experience, an internship in counseling therapy can be a great way to gain hands-on experience in the mental health field. During my internship, I had the opportunity to work with a diverse range of clients and assist with a variety of tasks, such as conducting intakes and leading group therapy sessions.One of the benefits of an internship in counseling therapy is that it can help you build a professional network. You'll have the opportunity to connect with other mental health professionals and potentially even secure a job after your internship is over.

However, it's important to keep in mind that an internship in counseling therapy can also be challenging. You'll be working with clients who are dealing with a wide range of issues, and it can be emotionally taxing at times. It's important to have a strong support system in place and to practice self-care to avoid burnout.If you're interested in pursuing an internship in counseling therapy, I would encourage you to reach out to local mental health clinics or private practices to see if they have any opportunities available. You can also speak with your academic advisor or career center to learn more about internship opportunities in your area


Limitations

As therapists, we have certain limitations that we must be aware of. One of the biggest limitations is that we can't "fix" our clients' problems or make them go away. Our role is to provide support, guidance, and tools to help clients manage their symptoms and work through their issues. Ultimately, it's up to the client to do the work and make the changes they need to improve their mental health.

Another limitation is that we can't force our clients to follow our advice or recommendations. We can offer suggestions and strategies, but it's up to the client to decide whether or not they want to try them. This can be frustrating at times, especially when we see clients struggling and we know what could help them.

Finally, we have to be mindful of our own biases and limitations as therapists. We all have our own experiences and perspectives, and it's important to recognize when those might be influencing our work with clients. We also have to be aware of our own limitations in terms of our training and expertise. If we encounter a client with a specific issue that we're not qualified to address, we need to refer them to someone who is.

Overall, being a therapist can be incredibly rewarding, but it's important to be aware of our limitations and work within them to provide the best possible care to our clients.

Future scope

As a counseling psychology student, I'm excited about the future scope of this field. With mental health awareness on the rise, there's a growing need for trained professionals who can provide support and guidance to those in need.

One area of growth in counseling psychology is the use of technology to provide mental health services. This includes teletherapy, online counseling, and mobile apps that provide mental health support. These technologies make it easier for people to access mental health services from the comfort of their own homes.

Another area of growth is the focus on diversity and inclusion in counseling psychology. As our society becomes more diverse, it's important for mental health professionals to be able to work with clients from a variety of backgrounds and cultures. Counseling psychology programs are placing a greater emphasis on cultural competence and diversity training to prepare students for this shift.

Finally, there's a growing need for counseling psychology services in non-traditional settings, such as schools, workplaces, and community centers. This presents new opportunities for counseling psychologists to work with clients who might not otherwise seek out mental health services.

Overall, I believe that the future of counseling psychology is bright, and I'm excited to be a part of this field as it continues to grow and evolve
