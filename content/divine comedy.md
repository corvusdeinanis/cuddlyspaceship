1.**Limbo** - Limbo circle includes souls who are **not sinful**, **but did not accept Christ**, therefore they do not deserve enough to live in Heaven

before they enter 2nd circle and beyond, encounter **Minos**. He judges peeps and sends them to where they deserve

**2.  Lust** - *caught up in and whipped around for eternity in the cyclones of wind*. This punishment is *symbolic*. Just as the wind is forever changing direction and never settles down, so these sinners are guilty of frequently changing lovers or sexual partners.**

**3. Gluttony** - **overindulge**, ordinary people; lie rotting away in a *never ending icy rain in slush*, overlooked by <u><b>Cerberus</u></b>

**4.Greed** / Avarice and Prodigality - souls are divided into two
groups, one is **hoarding** people, and another is **squandering** people. This group will **use their chest to push weights to another group** as a torture form. Does NOT interact with any inhabitants

**5. Wrath** - fighting in <u>River Styx</u> eternally
   bottom of river -> spiteful ones trying to scream

**City of Dis** (6th - 9th circles of hell) - Always on fire 

6. **Heresy** -> Not believing in God, punished in burning
tombs  
-- minotaur --
7. **Violence** ->the Outer, Middle, and Inner ringsâ€”housing different types of violent criminals. 
	i. **Outer** ->  Those who were violent against people and property   -> guarded by Centaurs 
	ii. **Middle** -> People violent against themselves (sui) perpetually eaten by Harpies 
	iii. **Inner** -> blasphemers -> violence against God

8. **Fraud** -> panderers/seducers; flatterers; 
   sorcerers/astrologers/false prophets; thieves; false counselors/advisers, impersonators,
Diff punishment for diff crime. Symbolic, again. For eg, fortune tellers have head backwards

9. **Treachery** -> deepest circle of Hell, where Satan resides. 
a) Caina,
b)Antenora
c)Ptolamaea 
d) Judecca 

**Freezing Cold**

Center of Hell -> **Satan** -> three headed, eating three peeps; 
**Cassius, Brutus, and Judas**
