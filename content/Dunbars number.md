**148**, or 150 
- **suggested cognitive limit** to the people with whom one can maintain social relationships with. 
- Proposed by **Robert Dunbar**, British anthropologist. 
- Found a link between primate brain size and average group size

Dunbar predicted a human "mean group size" of **148** (casually rounded to 150), a result he considered **exploratory** because of the **large error measure** (a 95% confidence interval of 100 to 230)
