[[August Comte]]'s theory of development of human intellect. Detailed in his seminal *Cours de Philosophie Positive* (The Course in Positive Philosophy)

### The three stages: 
#### 1. Theological 
supernatural or divine powers; personified deities
fetishism/animism -> polytheism -> monotheism 

#### 2. Metaphysical 
extension of the theological stage
abstract forces govern our world 
#### 3. Positivist 
scientific, rational
