# Bureaucrats vs Politicians - What’s The Difference? 

  

## Who are “Bureaucrats”?
Bureaucrats are officials that make up the executive arm of the government. They are responsible for the day-to-day implementation of rules and everyday administration. Bureaucrats, in India, are civil servants or those who work as a part of the civil services. The Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service, and Indian Forest Service all come under this. 

## Who are “Politicians”? 
A politician simply is a person who is active in party politics or holds a position in the government.  They can work at a local, state, national, or even international level. All members of the government, all the elected officers and those contesting are politicians. From the local councillors to the mayor to the president. 
  
## Key Differences - 

### 1. **Permanency** 
Bureaucrats are permanent members of the government. They cannot be removed, only retired. The same cannot be said of politicians holding posts of power. People hold posts, other people overtake them; ruling parties change.     
### 2. **Neutrality** 
Bureaucrats need to remain neutral on matters that concern the nation and the government. They cannot express their opinions and must maintain this stance. Politicians however not only express their opinion but also use it to gather followers and gain votes.  

##    

Politicians are voted into position, whereas bureaucrats need to go through rigorous testing. **Max Weber** says that bureaucracy is “the basis for the systematic formation of any organisation and is designed to ensure efficiency and economic effectiveness”
