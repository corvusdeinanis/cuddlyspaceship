Unpleasant memories in childhood
Childhood memories and experiences shape us into who we are as
adults and how we think and perceive life.
Traumatic memories often are remembered more clearly, and affect
people even after they mature into adults.

Charles Dickens ' Struggle With Traumatic Memories
In the movie, Charles Dickens often has nightmares about his
childhood. His family's financial state forced him to start working at a very young
age. The working conditions were very poor and he was bullied by the other
kids. As the movie progresses, Charles slowly overcomes the resentment
he feels towards his father, because of whom he had to work.

"Whether the Christmas visions would or would not convert Scrooge,
they convert us," he wrote.
This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically
different Scrooges in the tale—one a cold, stingy recluse, the other a
benevolent, loving man
In a way, the story can be interpreted as progress in therapy.
In the beginning, Scrooge is a miser who only cares about business.
He doesn’t care about anything else.
He thinks it is humbug to “muck around in the past”
