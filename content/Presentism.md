> *In literary and historical analysis, presentism is a term for the introduction of present-day ideas and perspectives into depictions or interpretations of the past. Some modern historians seek to avoid presentism in their work because they consider it a form of cultural [[bias]], and believe it creates a distorted understanding of their subject matter. The practice of presentism is regarded by some as a common [[logical fallacy|fallacy]] when writing about the past.*
