named after **Lev Kuleshov**, Russian director
1910s

important editing style; 

it says that ***viewers derive more meaning from the interaction of two sequential shots than from a single shot in isolation***

alternating a shot of an expressionless actor with different shots of objects or scenes, such as a bowl of soup, a girl in a coffin, or a woman on a divan. The audience attributed different emotions to the actor’s face depending on what he was “looking at”, even though the footage of the actor was the **same** each time

basically, context adds a lot of meaning

used it to show power of editing

this along with **montage** made up early soviet cinema
