Definition: A **stroke**, or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), occurs when there is a **sudden interruption of blood flow to the brain**, typically due to a blood clot or a ruptured blood vessel. This can lead to brain damage and various symptoms.

Symptoms: Symptoms of a stroke can include **sudden numbness or weakness on one side of the body**, **trouble speaking**, **confusion**, **severe headache**, and **difficulty walking**.

Treatment: Treatment for a stroke often involves emergency medical intervention to restore blood flow to the brain. This can include medications to dissolve blood clots or surgical procedures. Rehabilitation may be needed to address physical and cognitive impairments.

Psychological Rehabilitation: Psychological rehabilitation for stroke survivors may involve addressing emotional issues, such as depression and anxiety, that can result from the physical and cognitive changes following a stroke. Therapy, counseling, and support groups can be beneficial.
