Skeuomorphic design - design that mimics real life objects. Usually used so it is more intuitive to use 

"*Skeuomorphs may be deliberately employed to make a new look more familiar and comfortable or may be the result of cultural influences and norms on the designer. They may be the artistic expression on the part of the designer.*"^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph]

They can be physical objects (light bulbs shaped like candle flames) or virtual / digital (a toggle switch, a button).

Don Norman notes in  The Design of Everyday Things that early automobiles were designed after horse-drawn carriages, (some of which even included a wooden horse head on the front to try to minimize scaring the real animals).

Best example -> Audio software that has knobs and controls that look like the physical objects.
