[[T.S Eliot]]

essay on **J.C. Grierson’s edition of Metaphysical Lyrics and Poems of the 17th Century**

not just an essay or critique, caused **revival in interest** in poets like Donne

**Dissociation of Sensibility** and **Unification of Sensibility**


examine whether the so-called ‘metaphysical’ poets constituted a school or movement in themselves, or were they merely a continuation of some older tradition.

Difficulties - 
1) defining metaphysical
2) deciding which poets are part of it and which aren't
3) different schools - Donne, and Courtly, Religious 

Characteristics - 
1. **elaboration of a simile to the** farthest possible extent
2. **development of an image by rapid association of thought**; unifying different pictures 
3. sharp contrasts

Dr Johnson's defn - 
**“the most heterogeneous ideas are yoked violence together”**
fusion of opposite and dissimilar concepts
but happens in all poetry, TS points this out. 
Therefore, Dr Johnson - is wrong

So TS decided to define it via positive approach
***“were the direct and normal development of the precedent age”***

**he would show that metaphysical poetry is distinguished from other poetry by unification of sensibility, and that subsequently, dissociation of sensibility, overtook English poetry, and this was unfortunate**


**a unification of thought and feeling** - unification of sensibility


**The poets of the 18th century were intellectuals, they thought but did not feel; the romantics of the 19th century felt but did not think. Tennyson and Browning can merely reflect or ruminate**

A thought to Donne was an experience; it modified his sensibility

  
**Metaphysical Sensibility**
**enabled them to assimilate and fuse into new wholes most disparate and heterogeneous experiences.** **They could feel their thoughts as intensely as the odour of a rose, that is to say they could express their thoughts through sensuous imagery**

**Under Milton and Dryden** -
Language became more refine
feeling became more crude

Conclusion - **that they are neither quaint nor fantastic, but great and mature poets**
