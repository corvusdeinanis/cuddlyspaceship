in psychoanalysis, the **narcissism of small differences** is the idea that the **more** a relationship or community shares **commonalities**, the **more** likely the people in it are to engage in interpersonal feuds and mutual ridicule because of **hypersensitivity** to **minor** differences perceived in each other

Coined by [[Sigmund Freud]]
