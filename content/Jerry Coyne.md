Coyne considers himself a secular Jew, and an outspoken anti-theist
claims that religion and science are fundamentally incompatible
scientists who hold religious views are only reflective of the idea, "that people can hold two conflicting notions in their heads at the same time" ([[cognitive dissonance]])
