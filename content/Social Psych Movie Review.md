## Introduction

Mental illness has long been stigmatized. Though we live in the 21st century, mental health is neglected, and worse yet trivialized. Mental illnesses have been used as common tropes in all forms of art. From books to paintings to movies. People with mental illnesses are stereotyped and put into boxes. We have barely begun acknowledging the mental health crisis around us. 

  

Movies centered around mental disorders are usually exploitative. They twist and turn an illness to suit their nefarious purposes. They promote stereotypes, stop conversations before they even start, and stigmatize disorders and those suffering from them. Most of the movies are offensive, disrespectful and give the wrong message.

  

Thanks to movies, shows, and recently, TikToks, the world can list more mental illnesses while somehow knowing less than before about mental health. Phrases that were used in a therapeutic setting are now part of everyone’s vocabulary, part of the collective consciousness. They not only dilute the importance but also trivialize the struggles faced by those affected. 

  

## Mental Illness in Movies

Historically, mental health representation in movies has been awful. Grossly misrepresented, caricatured, and even demonized. From 1960’s Psycho to 2016’s Split and more. In my opinion, movies on mental illness (or movies that have mental illness playing a large role) do one of the following -

1. Reduce people with mental illnesses to villains and “maniacs”.  
    This is a very common trope seen in all forms of entertainment. 
    
2. Sensationalize and misinform.  
    For example, any movie that has a character with Dissociative Identity Disorder or as it was known earlier, multiple personality disorder. The movies represent the disorder in a very negative light (Split, Anniyan, Three Faces of Eve) and further stereotypes. People with DID are not like their movie counterparts at all. 
    
3. Romanticize mental illness.  
    Romanticisation of mental disorders has always existed. Tropes like the damaged artist, or artist in excruciating pain (Sometimes I feel like people know van Gogh more for being an artist in pain than for being an artist). They trivialise and almost make mental disorders seem “desirable”. They glamourize mental illnesses.
