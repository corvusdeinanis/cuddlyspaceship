four events that Gautama Buddha experienced in his life, which led him to realize the impermanence and ultimate dissatisfaction of conditioned existence. ^[Also changed my life]Before these encounters, Gautama Siddhartha had been confined to his palace by his father, who feared that he would become an ascetic if he came into contact with the sufferings of life according to a prediction. However, his first venture out of the palace affected him deeply and made him realize the sufferings of all, and compelled him to begin his spiritual journey as a wandering ascetic, 
which eventually led to his enlightenment.



The Four Sights are as follows:

1. **Old Age**: On his first venture out of the palace, Siddhartha saw an old man. This was the first time he had seen someone who was old and frail. This sight made him realize that everyone grows old and that youth is temporary.
2. **Sickness**: On another occasion, Siddhartha saw a sick person. This was the first time he had seen someone who was ill. This sight made him realize that everyone is subject to sickness and pain.
3. **Death**: On yet another occasion, Siddhartha saw a dead body. This was the first time he had seen a corpse. This sight made him realize that everyone dies and that death is inevitable.
4. **Asceticism**: Finally, Siddhartha saw an ascetic who had renounced the world in search of spiritual enlightenment. This sight inspired him to leave his life of luxury and become an ascetic himself.

These Four Sights are considered pivotal events in the life of Gautama Buddha and are often depicted in Buddhist art.
