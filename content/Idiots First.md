### Summary
Mendel is the main character. He wants to send his son, Isaac, to his uncle so that his life is secure. To do so, Mendel requires 35 Dollars for the train ticket. Isaac is mentally challenged. 

Mendel pawns his watch and gets 8 dollars. 

Mendel knows that he is about to die. He wants to make sure his son's life is set before he dies. Death is personified and takes the form of Mendel's friend, Ginzburg.

> [!NOTE] Personal
> I don't think there are any diasporic elements, or at least nothing explicitly mentioned. 

> Literary scholar Victoria Aaron offers another take, arguing that Malamud’s story evokes the Binding of Isaac—except that Mendel, the Abraham figure, “refuses to sacrifice that which he loves most. Like his biblical predecessor, Mendel is called forth to do the inconceivable. But unlike Abraham, Mendel . . . will not acquiesce to the commanding voice of the law.”
