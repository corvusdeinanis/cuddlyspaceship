# Perception
## Definition
the **organization**, **identification**, and  **interpretation** of sensory information to  represent and understand the environment.
##
**Sensation**: the process by which our sense organs  
receive information from the environment.

we gain information about the properties and elements of the environment
helps us navigate and understand the world around us
helps us interact w environment
helps us survive

**Psychophysics** is the study of the relationship between the physical aspects of stimuli and our psychological experience of them

---
Senses - (five senses)
proprioception
social cues

**Absolute threshold**: the <u>smallest intensity</u> of  
the stimulus that must be present for it to be  
<u>detected</u>.  

**Difference threshold**: the smallest level of  
stimulation required to <u>sense that a change</u> has  
occurred.  

**Just noticeable difference**: The minimum  
stimulation required to <u>detect the difference</u>  
between the two stimuli.

**Adaptation**: An adjustment in sensory capacity  
following prolonged exposure to stimuli.

---
**top-down processing** Perception that is guided by higher-level knowledge, experience, expectations, and motivations

**bottom-up processing** Perception that consists of the progression of recognizing and processing information from individual components of a stimuli and moving to the perception of the whole.

## Gestalt Laws of Perceptual Organisation
Gestalt School 
*'the whole is something else than the sum of its parts'*
**Wertheimer, Koffka, Kohler**
20th Century

**_Gestalt_** is used in modern German to mean the way a thing has been “placed,” or “put together

### illusion
a **misrepresentation** of a “real”  sensory stimulus
an interpretation that contradicts objective “reality” as defined by general agreement
universal unlike hallucinations
real stimuli, wrong interpretation

### Monocular and Binocular Cues

Depth[Depth Perception] ---> a[monocular] & b[binocular]

  

n[the visual ability to perceive <br> world in 3D <br> ability to gauge <br> how far an object is ]

  

a --- d[one eye] --- f[bad at depth]

b --- e[two eyes] --- h[diff angles helps]

  

n --- m[relies on the convergence <br>  of both eyes upon a <br> single object]

m --- x[navigating, determing dist, <br> avoiding, etc]
```

lateral displacement of the eyes that provides  
two slightly different views of the same object 
allowing **STEREOPSIS** / two images which helps 
us discern depth better

| **Relative Size** <br> size constancy - smaller = far                     |   **Retinal Disparity**        |
| **Interposition** <br> Overlapping objects, object that overlaps = closer |      **Binocular Convergence**     |
| **Linear Perspective**            <br>  converging of parallel lines      |           |
| **Aerial**   <br>  scattering of blue light; far hill appears blue <br> closer hill more contrast                                                       |           |
| **Light and Shade**       <br>  Highlights and shadows help us understand dimensions <br> of object, where light is coming from, etc                                               |           |
| **Ponzo Illusion** | |

**Perceptual constancy**
refers to the tendency to perceive an object you  
are familiar with as having a constant shape, size, and brightness
e.g. - **moon illusion**

Size Const.
Shape Const.
Colour Const.

Real and Apparent motion

Apparent Motion - 
- Phi Phenomena  - bulbs in row, flashing, feels like moving
• Motion after effect (MAE)  
• Induced motion  - train moving next to you, you feel like you are moving
• Autokinetic movement - dark room, singular light, feels like moving
