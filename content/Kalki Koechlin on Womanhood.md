of course we'll be **hysterical**; we don't even have the right to BREATHE 

- how every behaviour is policed and scrutinized; including just BREATHING
- how everything is "tainted" by man being in the center 
	- [[Microaggression]]
	- latent misogyny
leaks into every facet of life 
## intro

in the beginning God made man remember that God made man in his own image
what chance in hell did we ever have we were sidelined from I don't know the Big Bang
**some people found it practical to blame one woman for all of mankind's evil** - Adam and Eve
how it was **rigged** from the start
men make the rules

### mythology
adam and eve
*Draupadi* probably married off to the fire fund of us she garland did only Arjun but they said marry all of us five husbands 
Gaia the goddess, mother earth she's the one we all trampled on 
Aphrodite the queen of love and beauty also the patron of prostituting 
Persephone r@ped by Hades 
**not even goddesses were left alone** 
you might not know Aisha she was one of the wives of Prophet Mohammed and after he passed she challenged the Khalifa for power as you could imagine it created quite a ruckus led to war in fact all because of one woman's fuss and so was born the tradition Islamic that women should not engage in anything politics 
mentions Virgin Mary, Cleopatra, the suffragette, Marilyn Monroe 

## pressure to conform
sometimes I just want an oversized t-shirt boxer shorts unkempt hair and unibrows I want armpit hair long enough to plait 

have to **sit** in a certain way, talk in a certain way

"starving to be me"
"what am i complaining about what am i complaining about what right do I have to complain"
"keep uneducated keep submissive keep under your control"
"men will you stop whistling at me, calling me loose, slutty,.."
"dear women will you at least end up for me"

## sexualisation of women
hard to breathe right 
it's hard to breathe when you have a man pounding on top of you incessantly like a daily routine it's hard to breathe when he turns over and goes to sleep leaving you completely unsatisfied sexually 
oh it's hard to breathe when your clothes are too tight or the underwire of your bra is poking into your ribs or it's too hot to be wearing all this *it's hard to breathe when you want to stop being stared at but everyone always is rickshaw-walla, the  watchman, the neighbor's husband. they're all watching a chest heave every time you breathe*. S*ometimes as a woman you feel guilty to just breathe*

## role of religion
religion tells you to cover up, 
religion tells you to cover up your religion tells you to shave your head your religion tells you to be meek keep your eyes lowered keep having children keep your mouth shut what if your religion told you to hate the other what if your religion told you to burn alive on a funeral pyre what if your religion told you to do whatever you felt like split screen gossips fight lose control make noise pollute marry a child perform and honor killing r@pe torture discriminate keep breaking the law

in our land politics and religion go hand in hand

Has God become a politician?
