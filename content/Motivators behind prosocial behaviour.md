1. Empathy - Altruism 
   more similar to us, more empathetic
   selective altruism 
   harder to empathize with a number than a specific person 
2. Negative State Relief
   to make us feel better 
   unhappiness -> more prosocial behavior 
3. Empathic Joy
   not because empathy but due to feelings of accomplishment
   eg. groups of students asked to give advice to a girl who dropped out. Those who were told they'd find out what the student decided were more likely to help
4. Competitive Altruism
5. Kin Selection Theory
   states that we help ourselves by helping people
   who share our genes. Evolutionary perspective
