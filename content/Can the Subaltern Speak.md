Spivak says that the [[Subaltern]] cannot speak; if they do, they're not subaltern any more

Subaltern refers to the voiceless. If someone from the marginalized communities are able to voice something out, then they have relative privilege and aren't truly representative of the subaltern

And even when people from marginalized sections of the society speak, they will only be *interpreted*, not heard. That is, they will be understood through the lens of the hegemony.
