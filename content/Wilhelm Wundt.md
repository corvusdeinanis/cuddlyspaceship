German scientist  
widely regarded as the **founder of psychology as a scientific discipline**. 

Established the first psychology laboratory in **Leipzig** in **1879**, where he conducted experiments on reaction times, perception, attention, and other aspects of conscious experience. 

He used a method called introspection, which involved trained observers reporting their mental processes under controlled conditions. He aimed to discover the basic elements of consciousness and how they combined to form complex mental phenomena. His approach was known as structuralism.
