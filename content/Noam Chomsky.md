American linguist and cognitive scientist 
regarded as the father of modern linguistics

proposed that humans have an innate capacity for language acquisition that is governed by universal rules or principles. He argued that **language is not learned through imitation or reinforcement but rather through an internal mechanism called the language acquisition device (LAD)**.

He also challenged the behaviorist view of language by demonstrating that **language is not a simple stimulus-response phenomenon but rather a complex system
of generative grammar that allows infinite combinations of words and meanings**
