# Waves of Feminism


## 1st Wave (1830’s – early 1900’s)
Otherwise known as the **Suffrage** movement, 1st Wave Feminism focused on legal issues, primarily on gaining the right to vote.

## 2nd Wave (1960’s-1980’s)
Coming after World War II, the second wave of feminism focused on the workplace, sexuality, family and reproductive rights. During this time women were fighting not only for gender equality, but also civil rights and freedom of sexuality.

## 3rd Wave (1990’s – present)
The main issues feminism is fighting today are similar to those of the second wave, however feminism has gained popularity and is now more widely accepted in the mainstream. Though we are yet to achieve full gender equality, in terms of reproductive rights, equal pay, ending violence against women, and more, it’s important to note that we’ve come a long way since the first wave of feminism.

## 4th Wave (present; some say no 4th wave)
Many believe we are living in a new wave of feminism which has been enabled by the growing online feminist community. The new wave is sex-positive, body-positive, anti-misandrist (men hating), intersectional* (see intersectional definition), queer and trans inclusive and primarily digitally driven.
