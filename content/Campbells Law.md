  a social science principle that states that when a **metric is used as a target or indicator of performance, it tends to lose its validity and distort the system it is supposed to measure**. This is because people will try to manipulate or game the metric to achieve the desired outcome, rather than improving the underlying process or quality

Or, more important a metric, more likely it will be manipulated
