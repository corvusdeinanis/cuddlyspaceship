**mental shortcuts to make decisions**

A rule of thumb or a shortcut that helps solve a problem or make a decision quickly and efficiently.

Unlike [[algorithms]], it is **not always successful**. It cuts the time needed to make a decision, but it does not always guarantee a solution / the right solution. 

First formulated by Herbert A Simon - a cognitive psychologist and economist - in the 1950s 

More was added by [[Daniel Kahneman]] and Amos Tversky in the 1970s

common heuristics are
availability heuristic
	how readily we are able to come up with examples
representative heuristic
	making judgments or assumptions based on how closely something or someone fits our preconceived prototype or mental representation
anchoring and adjustment heuristics
	involves relying heavily on an initial piece of information (the anchor) and adjusting subsequent judgments or decisions based on that anchor
affect heuristic
	decisions based on our moods and emotions
