[[radical feminism]]

asserts that heterosexuality is not a biological 

was written in part to address the **erasure of lesbian existence** from scholarly feminist literature which she felt was not just anti-lesbian but also anti-feminist. It "distorts the experience of heterosexual women as well"

looks at **heterosexuality** as a **political institution** that disempowers women
- wants to change the system that shackles them and dismantle it
- hope that other lesbians felt the length and breadth of **women identification** and **women bonding**

> *we are the emotional and sexual property of men*

**autonomy of women threatens the family, religion, and state** [^1]

Addresses "[[feminism]]" that **excludes** lesbian identity
*The lesbian, unless in disguise, faces discrimination in hiring and harassment and violence in the street* 

talks about [[Heteronormative|heteronormativity]], [[patriarchy]], heterocentric
how men **control** all aspects of the lives of women 
how that causes **erasure** of gay and lesbian identities
says homosexuality is NOT deviant
about "lesbian visibility"

> *"Heterosexuality is the tool of the oppressor"*
> it is forcible and subliminal 

## Foundation of Rich's Essay
Kathleen Gough's *The Origin of the Family* which detailed man's power over women.

According to Gough, a social anthropologist and feminist, men control women in both archaic and contemporary societies by using eight methods. These are: 

- Rejecting women’s sexuality
- Forcing male sexuality upon women
- Exploiting women’s labor
- Controlling or robbing women of their children
- Confining women physically
- Using women as transactional objects
- Depriving them of creativity
- Barring them from the academic and professional sphere or withholding knowledge

 This was used by Rich to develop her theory of compulsory heterosexuality, which argues that **heterosexuality is assumed and enforced by a patriarchal and heteronormative society**. 

"outward sexuality", "lesbian suffering"

## Lesbian Existence and Continuum
objects to the term _lesbianism_, which she sees as a **stigmatized** clinical term, instead advocating the terms **lesbian existence** for the historical and contemporary presence of lesbian creation and **lesbian continuum** to include the entire range of a woman-identified experience

![[lesbian continuum]]


At certain points in history, homosexual men and lesbians have shared a social existence, and acknowledged a common fight against society but  to treat the lesbian experience as a version of male homosexuality is to discard it


### Three Definitions of Lesbian
 - lesbian identity as an act of resistance
- lesbian identity is the sense of the self of a woman bonded primarily to women who are sexually, and emotionally 
- [[lesbian continuum]] and lesbian existence 

she says lesbianism is not just sexual but a political stance

she is [[Intersectional feminism|intersectional]], brings in **race** and **sexual identity**

not just **tolerate** but **include**

**personal notes**:

- radfem is supposed to be **provocative**! People dilute their thoughts and everything. [[Mainstream dilutes movements]]  Judging her and her work because of the tone is [[Tone Policing]]. You CAN'T tone police a member of the marginalized sect of society. 

- Queer people are seen under the microscope, scrutinized so much. Homophobic speech gets a pass. But God forbid someone says the opposite. 

- The MOVEMENT IS **NOT EXTREME**.  If you're cornered and beaten day in and day out for years, it is only self defense to fight back. Society only looks when the oppressed strike back but turns a blind eye towards the whole "violence" thing when it is the oppressed at the receiving end. 

- Revisionist =/= responding to criticism. It is erasing and making new history.
- Revised, not revisionist (?)
- Revisionist has negative connotations

[^1]: [[anarchism]]; forced hierarchies

- introduces the concept of a **lesbian continuum**, which includes various forms of women's relationships and resistance to male domination. She argues that *lesbian existence is not only about sexual orientation, but also about a political choice and a challenge to patriarchy*. 
- Rich criticizes the **heterosexual assumption**, which is the belief that women are naturally and innately attracted to men, and that heterosexuality is the only normal and natural sexuality. She claims that this assumption is based on male bias and ignorance, and that it erases and denies lesbian existence.
- Rich analyzes the **institution of motherhood**, which is often used to justify and enforce compulsory heterosexuality. She argues that motherhood is not a biological destiny, but a social construct that limits women's autonomy and potential. She advocates for a radical redefinition of motherhood, which recognizes women's agency and diversity. 
- Rich explores the **history and culture of lesbianism**, which is often hidden or distorted by mainstream sources. She cites examples of lesbian existence from various times and places, such as ancient Greece, medieval Europe, China, Africa, and Native America. She also discusses the role of literature and art in expressing and affirming lesbian identity. 
- Rich calls for a **feminist transformation** of society, which would challenge compulsory heterosexuality and create more possibilities for women's lives. She urges women to question their sexual assumptions and choices, and to support each other in their struggles for liberation. She believes that lesbian existence is a vital source of strength and inspiration for all women.

## Quotes
>"Pornography does not simply create a climate in which sex  and violence are interchangeable; it widens the range of behavior considered  acceptable from men in heterosexual intercourse-behavior which reiteratively strips women of their autonomy, dignity, and sexual potential, including the potential of loving and being loved by women in mutuality and integrity."

>“The effect of **male-identification** means ‘internalizing the values of the colonizer and actively participating in carrying out the colonization of one’s self and one’s sex… Male identification is the act whereby women place men above women, including themselves, in credibility, status, and importance in most situations, regardless of the comparative quality the women may bring to the situation…. Interaction with women is seen as a lesser form of relating on every level.”
