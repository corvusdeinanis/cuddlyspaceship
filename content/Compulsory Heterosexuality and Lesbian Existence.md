written by [[Adrienne Rich]]
first wrote it in 1980s (1986?)

[[radical feminism]]

was written in part to address the **erasure of lesbian existence** from scholarly feminist literature which she felt was not just anti-lesbian but also anti-feminist. It "distorts the experience of hetereosexual women as well"

looks at heterosexuality as a **political institution**
- disempowers women
- wants to change the system that shackles them 
- hope that other lesbians felt the length and breadth of **women identification** and **women bonding**
- Wanted to dismantle the political institution

>*we are the emotional and sexual property of men*

**autonomy of women threatens the family, religion, and state** [^1]
economic exploitation
patriarchal motherhood

Addresses "feminism" that **excludes** lesbian identity
*The lesbian, unless in disguise, faces discrimination in hiring and harassment and violence in the street* 

talks about [[Heteronormative|heteronormativity]], [[patriarchy]], heterocentric
how men control all aspects of the lives of women 
how that causes **erasure** of gay and lesbian identities
says homosexuality is NOT deviant
about "lesbian visibility"

revised document in 2004


> "Heterosexuality is the tool of the opressor"
> it is forcible and subliminal

**personal notes**:
peeps conflate cis with sexual attraction 
	trans women can be 

- radfem is supposed to be **provocative**! People dilute their thoughts and everything. [[Mainstream dilutes movements]]  Judging her and her work because of the tone is [[Tone Policing]]. You CAN'T tone police a member of the marginalized sect of society. 

- Queer people are seen under the microscope, scrutinized so much. Homophobic speech gets a pass. But God forbid someone says the opposite. 

- The MOVEMENT IS **NOT EXTREME**.  If you're cornered and beaten day in and day out for years, it is only self defense to fight back. Society only looks when the opressed strike back but turns a blind eye towards the whole "violence" thing when it is the oppressed at the recieving end. 

- Revionist =/= responding to criticism. It is erasing and making new history.
- Revised, not revisionist (?)
- Revisionist has negative connotations
