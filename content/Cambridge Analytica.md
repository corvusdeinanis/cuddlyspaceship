offshoot of a British company called SCL Group (formerly Strategic Communication Laboratories) and was set up as a U.S. subsidiary company of SCL.

The company targeted Facebook and other social media platforms to run advertisements based on user profiles, including ads for political campaigns. ***It infamously attempted to use the psychological profiles of roughly 90 million Facebook users to influence their political decisions***

In 2018, the company became the subject of widespread criticism following reports that it **purchased data from a British academic concerning the personal psychological profile of roughly 270,000 Facebook users**. Due to the terms and conditions of the Facebook platform at that time, the company was able to indirectly access data from the Facebook friends of those users.
