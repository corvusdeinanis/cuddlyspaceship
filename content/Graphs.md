Bar Diagram -  * 1 Dimensional or two dimensional?
Height or length = size of data
Can measure frequency type and non-frequency type
Can represent Discrete data and continuous data
Better for non-freq data

Component Bar Diagram – Useful in comparing sizes of different component parts. Helps us understand the relationship between these two. 
Has two or more components
Height is proportionate to size of data

Multiple Bar Diagram – COMPARING TWO OR MORE SETS OF DATA. 

Pie Chart – Two Dimensional (2D). 
Area is proportionally divided among components
100 equal parts of 3.6% each


Geometric Diagram

1. Bar Diagram
	• Simple Bar
	• Multiple Bar
	• Component Bar

2. Pie Diagram / Chart


Frequency Diagram

3. Histogram

4. Frequency Polygon

5. Frequency Curve

6. Ogive  (Cumulative Frequency Curve)

7. Arithmetic Line Graph (Time Series Graph)


Histogram   -  2D / 2 Dimensional figure. Area of rectangles is proportional to frequency if class width is same. Represent continuous data. No space between rectangles.  Can be used to find Mode

Frequency Polygon – Plane bounded by lines. Midpoints of rectangles in histogram can be joined to make this. Area under the curve = total frequency or sample size. Grouped data

Frequency Curve   - Freehand curve that passes through the points of frequency polygon as closely as possible.

Ogive – Two types – Less than, More than. Grouped. Gives Median.

Arithmetic Line Graph – Time on x-axis, variable along y-axis
