a measure of how many people actually read the book

invented by mathematician **Jordan Ellenberg** writing for the Wall Street Journal

>*"mock mathematical measure on how far people will, on average, read through a book before giving up"*

It is calculated based on the most popular highlights marked by Kindle users. If there is a large concentration of quotes in the beginning but lesser as it progresses, the book ranks low on the index. It attempts to measure how **spread** out the highlights are. 

Named after Stephen Hawking's book *A Brief History of Time* which is a popular book that people start but don't finish. The HI of the book was 6.6%.
