### Criticisms
Shirley Geok-lin Lim said of Kingston's work "representations of patriarchal, abusive Chinese history were playing to a desire to look at Asians as an inferior spectacle"

Playwright and novelist Frank Chin has severely criticized Kingston's The Woman Warrior, stating that Kingston deliberately tarnished the authenticity of Chinese tradition by altering traditional stories and myths to appeal to white sensitivities
