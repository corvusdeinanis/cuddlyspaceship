A species concept is a framework for differentiating different species. There are at least 26 recognized species concepts, and difficulty in reconciling these various definitions is collectively called the species problem. 

A species concept that works well for sexually reproducing organisms such as birds may be useless for species that reproduce asexually, such as bacteria. The scientific study of the species problem has been called microtaxonomy.
