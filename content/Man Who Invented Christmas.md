“It was the best of times, it was the worst of
times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age

light, it was the season of darkness, it was the
spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.”

"Whether the Christmas visions would or would not convert Scrooge,
they convert us," he wrote.
This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically
different Scrooges in the tale—one a cold, stingy recluse, the other a
benevolent, loving man
In a way, the story can be interpreted as progress in therapy.
In the beginning, Scrooge is a miser who only cares about business.
He doesn’t care about anything else.
He thinks it is humbug to “muck around in the past”
