written by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]
### Historical Context: 
**1792**, during enlightenment
during the [[French Revolution]]
Mary wrote her two vindications as part of a pamphlet war
wrote this one in response to Talleyrand-Périgord’s report on national education; dedicates the volume to him

All humans are placed by God so that "passions should unfold our reason".
God made women in his image

## Core Argument 
 *women are not inferior to men*, but need a proper education to develop their reason and virtue; society moulds women the way they are.

## 
- neglect of women’s education has caused great misery
- Women are taught that romance is the primary goal of their lives, and they are not encouraged to develop their reason or virtue
- bases her argument on the belief that **reason** is what makes people human, that **virtue** is what distinguishes people from one another, and that virtue is attained through **knowledge**
- rejects the common argument that men and women should aim to acquire different virtues.
- believes that although men and women generally have different duties in life, they should strive for identical virtues. But because women tend to be given a haphazard education, they are not given adequate opportunity to develop their reason and attain virtue. More often, **they’re taught to please men**, preparing themselves for only a brief period of life—that is, courtship and early marriage. **They aren’t even prepared to build sustainable marriages or to care for their children effectively**. they’re allowed to be driven by emotions and delicate sensibilities
- critique of [[Jean Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who argues that women only need to be educated inasmuch as it prepares them to serve men
- women have absorbed many of these oppressive standards because they haven’t been taught to distinguish between reason and prevailing prejudices. She also addresses the importance of childhood impressions, the **necessity of modesty for both sexes**, and the distinction between external reputation and virtue.
- **society pressures women to care primarily about external beauty**
- Women deserve the protection of civil laws
- She *advocates coeducation* at every stage, believing this will allow relations between the sexes to develop in more natural and healthy ways;  allowing them to be of greater use to society at large
- **calls for a “revolution” for women, reiterating that their subordinate status is due to men’s prejudices and not to any inherent weakness.**
- concerned with unequal relationships between men and women, including in marriage devotes more attention to the inadequate moral training which, she believes, leaves women ill-prepared to find worthy husbands and to build enduring marriages and families. What’s more, she argues that these weak families and unhappy marriages are in fact destructive for society as a whole

>*"if girls are taught to be preoccupied with physical beauty from a young age, it’s no surprise that they will be preoccupied with frivolous, external concerns as adults"*

>*"Sheltered girls, in other words, become sheltered and ineffectual women"*

not only does *typical girls’ education* **have limited utility in later life**, but it also sets them up for unhappiness in the marriages
inadequate education makes women vulnerable if anything goes wrong in marriage, especially after the early passion of marriage fades

Based on the principles instilled into women all their lives, it makes sense that many women agree to marry immoral men
highly vulnerable if she’s left a widow and must act on behalf of dependent children as well; she’s easy prey to suitors who might take advantage of her

the more educated, **the more useful these women will be in broader society**
women, as rational creatures made in the image of God, must develop their reason in order to properly regulate their emotions and, ultimately, to become virtuous
Reason is what elevates humanity over animals
> “strengthen our minds by reflection, till our heads become a balance for our hearts.”

women “have no other scheme to sharpen their faculties,” and, in fact, they are encouraged throughout their lives to be `“ever anxious about secondary things…instead of being occupied by duties.”` Even those duties which society views as inherently feminine—like motherhood—suffer as a result of this attitude.

Motherhood, which Wollstonecraft argues is the calling of a majority of women, requires maturity. Maturity doesn’t come naturally, but must instead be cultivated through continual attention to virtue and duty, which most middle-class women are unprepared for

compares women to “flowers which are planted in too rich a soil, strength and usefulness…sacrificed to beauty…the flaunting leaves, after having pleased a fastidious eye, fade, disregarded on the stalk, long before the season when they ought to have arrived at maturity.”

- **Criticism of education**: Wollstonecraft argues that education is **not** a preparation for life, but a **step to perfection**. She criticizes the **superficial** and **disorganized** education of women, which teaches them to be **pleasing** rather than **useful**.
  
- **Criticism of modesty**: Wollstonecraft defines modesty as a **soberness of mind** that does not think too highly of oneself. She claims that women are not truly modest, but only concerned with their **reputation** and **beauty**. She challenges the notion that women have different virtues from men, especially **chastity**.

> [!note]- **personal notes**  
>~~I think more radical texts are forgotten or erased. Liberalism always strikes. I'm sure there were more radical women back then, but people will listen only when their interests are in question. You always have to appeal to the majority; it is ALWAYS a compromise.
>You always have to pursue middle ground. 
>Example, Rosa Parks was not the first woman to protest the way she did, but she was MADE the first because the other woman was "too radical" ~~

>**edit 2023-07-16** - Reading more and more, it does feel like Wollstonecraft was not trying to take the middle path. She was radical through and through. 
>reminds me of [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarianism]]
