There are broadly two types of **cognitive processes**:

|Automatic|Controlled|
|:---:|:---:|
|spontaneous|voluntary,intentional|
|less processing power and resources|more power and resources|
|no effort required|conscious, deliberate effort|
|quick|takes longer because need to analyze, evaluate, integrate|

**Automatic processing** 
	shapes our initial reaction to social stimulus
	it is influenced by *past experiences*, [[schema]], stereotypes
**Controlled processing** 
	allows us to challenge and override automatic processing; make deliberate judgements

Both are important
