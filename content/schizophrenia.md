- **Delusional Disorder (DD)**:
  - Characterized by the presence of one or more delusions for a duration of one month or longer.
  - Does not typically include hallucinations, but if they occur, they are related to the delusional theme.
  - Daily functioning is not significantly impaired, and behavior is not notably odd or bizarre outside of the delusions.
  - Delusions are often plausible and could be about situations that could occur in real life, such as being followed, poisoned, infected, loved at a distance, or deceived by a spouse or lover.

- **Schizophreniform Disorder**:
  - Similar symptoms to schizophrenia but the duration of the disorder is shorter, ranging from one to six months.
  - Diagnosis may lead to a later diagnosis of schizophrenia if symptoms persist beyond six months.
  - Impairment in social and occupational functioning may occur, but it is not required for diagnosis.

- **Schizophrenia**:
  - A chronic and severe mental health disorder where individuals may experience delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms (such as reduced emotional expression or avolition).
  - Symptoms must be present for a significant portion of time during a one-month period, with some level of disturbance persisting for at least six months.
  - Schizophrenia can significantly impair personal, social, and occupational functioning.

- **Key Differences**:
  - The primary difference lies in the duration and severity of symptoms, with delusional disorder being more focused on delusions without the broader range of psychotic symptoms seen in schizophrenia.
  - Schizophreniform disorder serves as a sort of intermediate diagnosis, where the symptom duration is longer than brief psychotic episodes but has not yet met the chronic criterion of schizophrenia.
  - Age of onset can also differ, with schizophrenia often being diagnosed in late adolescence to early adulthood, while delusional disorder is more commonly diagnosed in middle to late adulthood.

Please note that these descriptions are based on general criteria from the DSM-5-TR, and actual diagnosis should be made by a qualified mental health professional. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of these disorders, it is important to seek professional help.
