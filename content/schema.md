**cognitive framework**

Schemas are *patterns* of thought or behavior that organize information into categories
*abstractions* that simplify a personâ€™s world
basic knowledge of an entity that serves as a guide to perception, interpretation, imagination, or problem solving
based on past experiences and knowledge

can also lead to biases and stereotypes if they oversimplify or distort our understanding of individuals or groups

(think _schematics_, as in plans)

[[Thinking and Reasoning]]
**schema vs mental set** - they are **NOT** the same. *schema is a framework, mental set is an approach to problem-solving*, more specifically, the tendency to approach the problem in the same way that was successful in the past
