then Blanche has had affairs with
several men including a 17 year old boy
in 

an attempt to escape the trauma
she's a desperate woman who's lost

order as a result he uncovers the truth
about Blanche's sexual history and
Laurel and uses it against her then

than Blanche willing to cast aside her
upper-class affectations to marry
Stanley a
working-class man Stella acts as a
mediator between Blanche and Stanley she
loves them both she refuses to believe
Blanche's story about being raped by
Stanley if Stella did believe it she
would not be able to live with her
husband instead
Stella betrays her sister helping

sexual history and Laurel Mitch becomes
disillusioned and bitter refusing to
marry her in the end he tries to prevent
Stanley from forcing Blanche to leave
but his attempt proves futile and he
remains a broken man dominated by
Stanley desire destruction and death
truth versus illusion repression and
dependence class differences passion and
sexuality these complex themes
underscore the relationships that drive
the action of the play a streetcar named
desire the play is for major characters
Blanche
Stanley Stella and Mitch are driven by a
variety of desires than almost always
lead to their destruction and to the
destruction of those around them for
example Blanche is torn between
conflicting desires of finding romantic
love and marriage that will protect her
from life's harsh realities but her
husband's death has driven her to sexual
promiscuity and drinking that drives her
away from these things
Blanche often resorts to lies to prevent
other people and possibly herself from
seeing the truth which ultimately leads
to her destruction
Stanley's greatest desires to maintain
his dominant position as head of the
family but his marriage to Stella is an
ongoing cycle of sexual desire and
violence when Blanche threatens his
domination of his family Stanley decides
to destroy her by exposing her
passed and by r\*ping her truth versus
illusion is a theme mostly playing out
through Blanche and Stanley Blanche has
trouble looking at the unvarnished truth
because of this she lives in the dimly
lit world of half-truths and illusion
hiding behind her refined often
manipulative southern manners but
Stanley is bluntly honest and crude and
he despises lying but has no compassion
for others he uses the truth as a weapon
to control and destroy Blanche for
stella compassion overrides truth and
she believes her sister's behavior is
understandable considering the tragic
outcome of Blanche's marriage in the end
stella chooses illusion over truth in
order to preserve her marriage
repression and dependence speak to the
place context a time when women were
expected to be dependent on men both
financially and emotionally a dependence
that dictated the course of their lives
the death of her young husband and the
loss of her family home have made
Blanche especially vulnerable and
Stella's financial emotional and sexual
dependence on her husband Stanley
trapped her in a wife with a horrible
man who abuses her and r\*pe her sister
class differences are depicted through
the characters clash in social classes
Blanche
bases her identity on being a refined
southern belle who appreciates the finer
things in life
Stella has left her upper-class
background behind to join Stanley
Blanche sees her sisters choice as a big
step down in social status but low-class
Stanley rips away Blanche's mask of
superiority disconfirms Blanche's view
of him as no better than an animal
represented by the in human jungle
voices and lurid reflections when he
r\*pe her
passion and sexuality of characters in
the play reflects the way they view the
world Blanche's sexual exploits are a
way for her to escape the reality of her
husband's suicide and the role she
played in it
Stanley exudes a confident animal
sexuality that binds him to his wife
Stella Stella is possessed by a need to
fulfill that sexual passion for Stanley
but Stanley also uses sexuality as a
weapon r\*ping Blanche in order to
dominate her
