Elliot Aronson is a distinguished American psychologist who has made significant contributions to the field of social psychology. He is best known for his research on cognitive dissonance, social influence, prejudice reduction, and the jigsaw classroom. 

Some of his notable works are:

- He conducted experiments to test and refine the theory of [[cognitive dissonance]], which explains how people rationalize their beliefs and actions when they are inconsistent. ^["it suggests that man is a rationalizing animal â€“ that he attempts to appear rational, both to others and to himself", Theories of Cognitive Consistency]
- He invented the jigsaw classroom, a cooperative teaching technique that promotes learning and reduces interethnic hostility and prejudice among students. 
- He developed the [[gain-loss theory of attraction]], which states that people are more attracted to those who increase their liking over time than those who are consistently positive or negative. 
- He wrote several influential books, such as The Social Animal, Age of Propaganda, and Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me), which apply social psychology to everyday life and social issues. 

He has received many awards and honors for his teaching, writing, and research, such as the William James Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Association for Psychological Science. 
He is also one of the most cited psychologists of the 20th century. He retired in 1994 but continues to teach and write.
