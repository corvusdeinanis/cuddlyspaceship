Leventhal’s model of self-regulation is based on the idea that *each person forms a cognitive representation of their illness*, which allows them to make sense of their symptoms. 

This illness *perception and the patient’s emotional response then guide behaviour towards managing the illness* (Leventhal et al., 1984). 

An illness perception is made up of **five major components**. 
- illness identity
- potential cause
- timeline
- consequences 
- how it may be controlled

Often patients with similar diseases can hold very different perceptions of their illness (Petrie and Weinman, 2012).
