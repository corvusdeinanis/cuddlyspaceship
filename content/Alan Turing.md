## Alan Turing 
was a mathematician and logician who is widely regarded as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence. He formulated the Turing machine model of computation, which is the basis for modern computers. He also devised the Turing test to measure machine intelligence and cracked the Enigma code during World War II. He died by cyanide poisoning in 1954.
