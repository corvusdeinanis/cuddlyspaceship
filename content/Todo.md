group does not have a goal; no membership needed?



Stream of consciousness is a literary technique that tries to capture the natural flow of a character's thoughts, feelings, and impressions in a continuous and uninterrupted way.   

One of the criteria used to evaluate the representation of women in fiction is the Bechdel test, which asks whether a work features at least two named women who talk to each other about something other than a man.   

Eliza was one of the first chatbots, created by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966, that simulated a conversation with a psychotherapist by using pattern matching and substitution.   

Cognitive bias is a systematic error in thinking that affects the judgments and decisions that people make.  

Sexy lamp theory is a variation of the Bechdel test that asks whether a female character could be replaced by a sexy lamp without affecting the plot.  

The Heinz dilemma is a hypothetical moral dilemma used by Lawrence Kohlberg to assess the stage of moral development in children and adults.  


Marcia's identity states are four possible outcomes of identity formation in adolescence, based on the presence or absence of exploration and commitment. They are: identity diffusion, identity foreclosure, identity moratorium, and identity achievement.  

Bowlby's theory is an attachment theory that suggests that humans have an innate need to form strong emotional bonds with others, especially caregivers, and that early experiences of attachment have lasting effects on social and emotional development.  

## Six Degrees 
Six degrees of Bacon is a trivia game based on the idea that any two actors can be linked through their film roles in six steps or less, using Kevin Bacon as an example.

## Social Construction of Gender
Kessler and McKenna's work was influenced by Harold Garfinkel in ethnomethodology (especially his analysis of Agnes in Studies in Ethnomethodology); [[Stanley Milgram]], their social psychology professor; and the sociologist Peter McHugh, McKenna's professor. Kessler and McKenna were the first to argue that the distinction between "gender" and "sex" is a socially constructed one and the latter (defined by biological markers) should not be privileged. 

Their articulation of what later became known as the social construction of gender was part of the foundation for works of ultimately more well-known gender theorists, [[Judith Butler]] (1990), [Anne Fausto-Sterling] (1992), and Kate Bornstein (1994). Kessler and McKenna's concept of "gender attribution" predated William Zimmerman and Candace West's concept of doing gender and Butler's concept of gender performativity.
