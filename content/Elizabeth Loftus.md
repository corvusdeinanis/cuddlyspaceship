American psychologist who is a leading expert on *human memory and eyewitness testimony.* 

She conducted groundbreaking research on memory distortion and false memories using methods such as misinformation effect, implanted memories, and lost-in-the-mall technique. 

She showed that ***memory is not a faithful record of reality but rather a reconstructive process that is influenced by various factors such as expectations, suggestions, emotions, and social pressures***. She also applied her findings to legal and forensic settings, such as court cases, police investigations, and therapy sessions.
