      gaining access to every scrap of knowledge about the universe
      represents Renaissance
      humanism, man is center 
      knowledge, thirst
      rejects medieval 
      
Dr Faustus -> Learned scholar, brilliant | Ambitious 
    but as he signs the pact he falls from grace and misuses his powers | Does not listen to good angel / others who ask him to repent and ask God for forgiveness but begs God when it is too late | Parallel -> Icarus 
    
Pride,  power corrupts, tragic hero
