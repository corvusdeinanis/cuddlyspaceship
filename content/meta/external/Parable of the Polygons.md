## Highlights

- Small individual bias can lead to large collective bias.

WRAPPING UP: 	 		 			
1. Small individual bias → Large collective bias. 			 			 			
When someone says a culture is shapist, they're not saying the individuals in it are shapist. They're not attacking you personally. 
   
2. **The past haunts the present. 
   Your bedroom floor doesn't stop being dirty just coz you stopped dropping food all over the carpet. Creating equality is like staying clean: it takes work. And it's always a work in progress.** 	
   
3. Demand diversity near you. If small biases created the mess we're in, small anti-biases might fix it. Look around you. Your friends, your colleagues, that conference you're attending. If you're all triangles, you're missing out on some amazing squares in your life that's - unfair to everyone. Reach out, beyond your immediate neighbors

- Today's Big Moral Message™ is that **demanding a bit of diversity in your spaces makes a huge difference overall**
