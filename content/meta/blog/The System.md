 **The system is a WIP**, it is a set of guidelines and ideas to help my ADHD brain to make sense of life. 

This will be extensive, but as of now, only contains principles.

## Key Principles
1. [[Get Started]]. Do anything. Even if it is small. That's the way to stave off [[act inertia]]
2. **Discipline** over motivation. Make it a habit. It's okay if it's just 5-10 minutes, do it. [[Incremental]] changes accumulate.
3. **Check In** - Be more [[active vs passive|active]] in your own life. There's no sense of progress and time works differently in our head. So, do regular check ins. This includes - 
	1. Revising and Reviewing Goaks
	2. Tracking Progress
	3. Adjusting Goals
	4. Making a note of these so it feels like we're getting somewhere instead of something nebulous and directionless
4. **Revise**
5. **Flexible** - one of the core tenets of the system. Keep it flexible. The system is a guide, a rough plan. It should be adaptable. 
6. **[[baseline|Find the Baseline]]**. **Track**. Record. Analyze the data. 
7. **Use the scientific method**. Find correlations, investigate them. Hypothesize, test them out. Record results.
