My letterboxd review : 

Might contain minor spoilers of sort. 

Glorious. Gorgeous. Greta is a genius. 

I LOVED the movie. But before I start talking about the movie I want to say this. Barbie (2023) is not just a movie. It is so much more. 

It's this experience, it's this event. It was cool seeing so many people in pink. I loved that so many people were sorta celebrating "Barbie Day" with their little photo shoots, spending time dressing up, the whole shebang. I even saw so many people have little picnics which is so cute! And I'm talking about like, people in their early 20s. I saw men wearing pink, middle school guys wearing Barbie shirts. Maybe it's just a meme for the 'gram, maybe not. Still amazing. 

Alright, let's dive into the movie. I was super hesitant to go watch this. Pay money for a commercial? No thanks. But the movie had wacky trailers and it has Greta's name attached to it, which made me reconsider. Was it a commercial? Well, not exactly. It doesn't feel like the usual corporate drivel. It is, after all, a movie based on a product and will lead to a large drive in the sales of the product. 

Barbie is a balancing act. And Greta and team are amazing tightrope walkers! 
Appease the execs, but not sell yourself out completely. 
Be meta, but just enough that it doesn't seemed super forced and unnatural. 
Be bold, but don't piss people of. (I mean, it still did piss people off. Some people feel threatened about this movie.)

The movie is not a shallow attempt to "fix" the history of Barbie. Or at the very least, it's not the only objective. Greta uses this as a vehicle to raise so many questions and address things that people don't really talk about. It handles mature themes effortlessly. So even if it is nothing but an advert at the end of the day, I'm glad it was made so more people watch and maybe  take something with them. 

Gorgeous set, LOOOVEEE the casting.  Margot and Ryan absolutely killed it. Everyone else did too. It was nice seeing Will Ferrel. His scenes were gold. Not a single actor felt miscast. Everything felt so natural.

Barbie is a surreal fever dream in the best sense of the phrase. It's wacky, it's funny, it's poignant. I can't believe I'm giving 5 stars to a movie about Barbie. So many moments that surprised me and moved me. Again, we're talking about a movie about a product but THIS IS CINEMA.
