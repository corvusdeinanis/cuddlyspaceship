Small changes over time -> Big changes

[[meta/blog/Get Started]]. Don't wait for motivation to suddenly arive. Even if it does, it does not stick around. Instead, cultivate discipline. 
Instead of postponing and procrastinating, set a tiny achievable goal and work on it every day. 

Your guitar lies collecting dust but you don't want to sell it because you will learn it some day (even though you know you're lying to yourself)? Well, don't wait for some fantastical magic free time to arrive. Practice for five minutes. Or ten.

Works with languages too. 

**Consistent effort** goes a long way.
