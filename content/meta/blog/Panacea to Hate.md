[[Stereotypes]] exist and as long as we are in our comfort zone, we will believe in the stereotypes. We will look at people in that lens. Labels, prejudice. 

Popular media [[dehumanization|dehumanizes]] people and I want to simply portray them and humanize them

All prejudice is learnt. One way to quell it is by actually talking to people and spending time with them. 

A lot of hate towards a group of people is towards a internalized notion of the people, an unfair representation.
