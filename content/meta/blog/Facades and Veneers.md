Closets. 
Closets. 
Closets.

Hide in one, then in another.

Endless matryoshka nesting doll.  

Cocoon yourself 
in a concoction of lies 
a life fabricated 
keeping up appearances

an existence
shrouded
hidden
in plain sight
condemned 
to secrecy
to life as a heretic

your identity 
an expression
in a forbidden tongue;
a language not spoken 
but said in hushed whispers 
clandestine.

entire lives concealed
forced underground
buried alive
stripped of legacy
forlorn and forsaken
erased

where we ever here?
what is a million bodies, a million voices,
when you can pull a veil over
and pat yourself on the back
have your cavalry of cavalier 
varnish and vanish
the already forgotten lives 

Minimize. Minimize
Occupy lesser space
shrink more
and more
and then some more 
till you dissolve
into mere nothingness
succumb to the void 

diminish

for you are confined
to the liminal places,
the cracks in the pavements.
