"What if, some day or night, a demon were to steal into your loneliest loneliness and say unto you:
This life as you now live it, and have lived it, you must live once more and enumerable times more and there will be nothing new in it. But every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will return to you, all in the same sequence and succession. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again and you with it, speck of dust!
Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a terrific moment when you would have answered him: you are a god and never have I heard anything more divine." - [[../Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]
