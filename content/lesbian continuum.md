coined by [[Adrienne Rich]]
in [[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence]]

theory claiming that all women have a lesbian potential
women's bonding is the only tool to dismantle patriarchy
fluid model of female sexuality

does not confine itself to just sex, but to other bonds between women
need to reduce dependence on men

 overall "range—through each woman's life and throughout history—of **woman-identified experiences**, not simply the fact that a woman has had or consciously desired genital sexual experience with another woman"

*women may not have a preference toward heterosexuality, but may find it imposed, managed, organized, propagandized, and maintained by society*
