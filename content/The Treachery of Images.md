Original French: _**La Trahison des Images**_
1929 painting by [[Rene Magritte]] (surrealist painter)

A painting of a pipe and below it there is text that says "_Ceci n'est pas une pipe_" which translates to "This is not a pipe"

>*The famous pipe. How people reproached me for it! And yet, could you stuff my pipe? 
>No, it's just a representation, is it not? So if I had written on my picture 
>"This is a pipe", I'd have been lying!*
>— René Magritte
