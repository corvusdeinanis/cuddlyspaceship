Interpersonal influence

### How Interpersonal influence can affect political networks: 

**Building coalitions**: can use their connections and relationships to bring together diverse groups with a common goal. This can be used to build a broad-based coalition of support for a particular policy or candidate. 
**Shaping public opinion**: can use their connections and relationships to shape public opinion on a particular issue. 
**Influencing policy decisions**
**Building trust**: Interpersonal influence is often most effective when it is based on trust
**Manipulation**: can also be used to manipulate others, to deceive or coerce them to gain advantage.
