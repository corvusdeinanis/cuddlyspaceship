"Think of it as arranging meat and veggies on a shish kabob skewer," explains Tim Harrower, a journalist at _The_ (Portland) _Oregonian_. "Start with a juicy red tomato -- an anecdote. Follow with a nut graph. Then add meat -- chunk after chunk after chunk -- until you reach the end, where you reprise with another tomato -- a final quote or anecdote."
