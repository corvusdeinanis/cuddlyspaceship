## Sourcing Development News
- grassroots where the actual work is being done; social scientists, activists, student groups, etc
- cases of success stories and failures 
- sources like government issued posters, advertisments, pamphlets etc are NOT good sources. They can be subject to **propaganda** and **bias**

- must be ready to **be mobile**, 
- attend seminars, symposiums, conferences, etc
- question, investigate

## Development Reporting For Press
commonly used formats in **print** mediums
- news features
- articles
- photo features

interviews with recipients of benefits of projects completed
evaluate impact on masses

**vernacular** press usually covers more; development is localized

## Development Reporting for Radio
**Rural Radio Forums** - forum of 10-20 villages gather, listen to the programme, and *discuss it*. The reason for success is in the *follow up*. Minutes of Meeting is recorded

**Community Radio** - local radio stations, made by the locals for the locals. Pool in resources and run it collectively

**Programs by AIR**

Lots of scope to write scripts and devise programmes. Can work as a freelancer.

Aim is to break the barriers in communication that plague those in need of development (literacy, etc)

## Development Reporting for Television
**visual medium**, more accessible in terms of communication barriers
is seen as more credible

must be **field-based**, not studio based
