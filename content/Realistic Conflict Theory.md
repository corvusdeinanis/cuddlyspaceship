Realistic conflict theory is a theory that explains how intergroup conflict and prejudice can arise from competition over limited resources and incompatible goals. According to this theory, groups tend to develop a sense of “us” versus “them” and view the outgroup as a threat or an enemy. The theory also suggests that intergroup conflict can be reduced by introducing superordinate goals that require cooperation between groups
