View that heterosexuality is the "default" mode

That everything other than cishet is unnatural or deviant

assigns [[Privilege]] to heterosexual people 

According to [[Adrienne Rich]], heteronormativity is the idea that heterosexuality is the *only natural*, *normal*, and *acceptable sexual orientation*. She coined the term "[[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence|compulsory heterosexuality]]" to describe *how women are **pressured** and **coerced** to conform to heterosexual **norms** and expectations by **patriarchal** society*. 

She argued that heterosexuality is not a biological instinct, but a *political institution that oppresses women and limits their choices, freedom, and potential*. She also challenged the binary and essentialist views of sex and gender that underlie heteronormativity, and advocated for lesbian existence and feminism as forms of resistance and liberation.
