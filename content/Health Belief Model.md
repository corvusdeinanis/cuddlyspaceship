## Health Behaviour

actions we perform to promote health and avoid conditions that will prevent us from falling sick 

### Health Belief Model
Once we form a belief, there is an attitude, we start taking action
belief -> attitude -> actions 

researchers have found out that people do not respond well to health awareness programmes. they take it lightly. for e.g. "don't drink contaminated water". At the same time there are people who are very receptive to these, people who are very receptive to things like vaccinations and personal hygiene 

People's belief, attitude, and **perceived benefit** , value of self efficacy, 
mental blocks /barriers 

1. Developed in 1950 (?v) to reduce barriers and understanding people to help better promote good health 
   
2. in HBM, there are four critical points:  
-**severity** of a potential illness: The probability that a person will change their health
behaviors to avoid a consequence depends on how serious they believe the
consequences will be.

- personâ€™s **susceptibility** to that illness: People will not change their health
behaviors unless they believe that they are at risk.

- benefits of taking a **preventive action**

-  **barriers** (perceived costs) to taking that action: One of the major reasons people
don't change their health behaviors is that they think doing so is going to be hard.
Changing health behaviors can require effort, money, and time.
