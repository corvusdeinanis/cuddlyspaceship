these place emphasis on the environmental factors
## Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Theory
Urie Bronfenbrenner proposed the ‘Ecological Systems Theory’ based on dynamic interactions that environments have on the child. 

### 5 Stages
environment of the child is a nested arrangement of structures, each contained within the next 
Microsystem 
	immediate environment; parents, siblings, teachers, peers 
Mesosystem
	Interaction between child's microsystems. eg. teacher and parents interaction 
Exosystem
	external system, not immediately encompassing the child
	eg neighbourhood 
Macrosystem
	cultural elements, socioeconomic factors, geography, ethnicity, etc
Chronosystem 
	normative and non-normative events/transitions in an individual's life
	moving to a different house, historical events, etc
