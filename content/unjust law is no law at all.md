unjust law is no law at all 
(in Latin: *lex iniusta non est lex*) 

expression supporting natural law
acknowledging that authority is not legitimate unless it is good and right

> Woe to those who make unjust laws,  
> to those who issue oppressive decrees,  
> to deprive the poor of their rights  
> and withhold justice from the oppressed of my people
-- **Isaiah 10** (Tanakh or The Old Testament) 


**Augustine of Hippo** said "for I think a law that is not just, is not actually a law" ("nam mihi lex esse non videtur, quae justa non fuerit") while discussing the [[problem of evil]]

**Thomas Aquinas** refers to Isaiah 10 in *Summa Theologica* - 
are man-made laws to be obeyed?
No. Unless they are legitimate in three ways:
    The Purpose: The law must be for the common good.
    The Author: It must be in the scope of the authority making the law.
    The Form: And its burden should be equal and apply to all.
