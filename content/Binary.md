# **Binary**

_Relating to, composed of, or involving two things._

When we use the term ‘binary’ in feminist discussion it is usually in relation to _[**gender**](https://rosie.org.au/relationships-2/gender-sexuality/gender-identity/)_ (i.e: gender binary) and the limiting belief that there are only two genders. It is also often used to discuss gender stereotypes or characteristics typically seen as either male or female. It is becoming more widely accepted (rightfully so) that gender exists on more of a spectrum and that we should move away from this limiting ‘binary’ idea. People who are ‘non-binary’ don’t identify as female/male or a woman/man.

## **Cis/Cisgender**

_Denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender corresponds with their birth sex._

To be cisgender (commonly shortened to ‘cis’) means that you have body parts that are categorised as female or male and you identify with that gender from birth. The term was first coined in the 90s to define the opposite of transgender. It is now often used to highlight the privilege of the majority of people who identify with their biological gender, and how people are treated differently in society based on their _[**gender identification**](https://rosie.org.au/relationships-2/gender-sexuality/gender-identity/)._
