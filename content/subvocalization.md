aka "silent speech"

**internal speech** typically made when reading; 
it provides the sound of the word as it is read

This is a natural process when reading, and it helps the mind to access meanings to comprehend and remember what is read, **potentially reducing [[cognitive load]]**. This inner speech is characterized by minuscule movements in the larynx and other muscles involved in the articulation of speech. Most of these movements are undetectable (without the aid of machines) by the person who is reading.
