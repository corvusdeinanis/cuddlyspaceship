I'm not sure if it is something I read somewhere or something I came up with, but I say "profane is profound". Sounds stupid, but hear me out. 

Yes, it is polemic. It is provocative on purpose. 

I find a problem with the concept of "[[sacredness]]". It is a form of [[social control]]. 

NOTHING should be above criticism.
