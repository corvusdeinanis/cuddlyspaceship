> *"It is a cultural revolution against the notion that faster is always better. The Slow philosophy is not about doing everything at a snail's pace. It's about seeking to do everything at the right speed. Savoring the hours and minutes rather than just counting them. Doing everything as well as possible, instead of as fast as possible. It’s about quality over quantity in everything from work to food to parenting."*

## Slow Thought
_Slow thought_ calls for a slow philosophy to ease thinking into a more playful and porous dialogue about what it means to live
Vincent Di Nicola's [Slow Thought Manifesto](https://aeon.co/essays/take-your-time-the-seven-pillars-of-a-slow-thought-manifesto) says there are 7 pillars of slow thought:
1. Slow thought is marked by peripatetic Socratic walks, the face-to-face encounter of Emmanuel Levinas, and Mikhail Bakhtin’s dialogic conversations
2. Slow thought creates its own time and place
3. Slow thought has no other object than itself
4. Slow thought is porous
5. Slow thought is playful
6. Slow thought is a counter-method, rather than a method, for thinking as it relaxes, releases and liberates thought from its constraints and the trauma of tradition
7. Slow thought is deliberate
