# Microaggression


> *"indirect, subtle, or unintentional discrimination against members of a marginalized group."*

was coined by **Chester M. Pierce**, a Harvard University psychiatrist
in 1970 
to describe insults and dismissals which he regularly witnessed non-black Americans inflicting on African Americans

Popularized by **D.W Sue**

A **subtle** or indirect form of discrimination or prejudice that is often unintentional or unconscious, but can cause harm or discomfort to the target group. For example, asking a person of color where they are really from, or complimenting a woman on her intelligence as if it is unusual. Microaggressions can affect people based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, or other aspects of their identity .

Psychologist Derald Wing Sue defines microaggressions as *"brief, everyday exchanges that send denigrating messages to certain individuals because of their group membership"*. The persons making the comments may be otherwise well-intentioned and unaware of the potential impact of their words.


## Types of Microaggressions: 

According to Sue _et al_., ^[https://doi.org/10.1037%2F0003-066x.62.4.271] microaggressions seem to appear in four forms:

### Microassault 
an explicit racial derogation; verbal/nonverbal; e.g. name-calling, avoidant behavior, purposeful discriminatory actions.

### Microinsult 
communications that convey rudeness and insensitivity and demean a person's racial heritage or identity; subtle snubs; unknown to the perpetrator; hidden insulting message to the recipient.

### Microinvalidation
communications that exclude, negate, or nullify the psychological thoughts, feelings, or experiential reality of a person belonging to a particular group.

### Environmental Microaggressions (Macro-Level)
Racial assaults, insults and invalidations which are manifested on systemic and environmental level.
