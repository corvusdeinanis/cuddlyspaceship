After World War II, modernization has been among the most powerful paradigms invoked to develop societies

>Based on **neoclassical** and **neoliberal** political theories and grounded in the grand project of **Enlightenment**, namely reasoning, rationality, objectivity, and other philosophical principles of **Western science** [^1]

> adopting a capitalist economic system, building up formal infrastructure, and acquiring technologies is prioritized. [^1]

modernization paradigm presumes a set of interrelated processes: capitalism, industrialization, surveillance of society, and control of means of violence.

**industrialization was considered the main route to successful economic growth**
did not include participation of locals
measured by quantitative indicators like GDP

traditional society -> urban society

**Western countries were treated as models of political, economic, social, and cultural modernization that Third World nations needed to emulate**

### Definition of Modernization
> *a transition, or rather a series of transitions from primitive, subsistence economies to technology-intensive, industrialized economies; from subject to participant political cultures; from closed, ascriptive status systems to open, achievement-oriented systems; from extended to nuclear kinship unites; from religious to secular ideologies; and so on. Thus conceived, modernization is not simply a process of change, but one which is defined in terms of the goals toward which it is moving.* ^[Tipps (1973)]

### Basic Tenets of Modernization Theory
1. can be achieved by increasing productivity, economic growth, and industrialization
2. causes of underdevelopment - internal causes of the country, individual and existing social structures
3. change can be brought about by changing attitudes, values, beliefs
4. shift from static agricultural, primitive, rigid society to a dynamic, industrialized and social mobility 

Focused on macroeconomic planning, urbanization, industrialization, trickle down economy
Advocated Private ownership of all facets of production;
Free trade at the global, national, and local levels (laissez-faire)

### Criticisms of Modernization Theory
- does not consider external constraints
- fails to distinguish between rich and developing countries in terms of resources requiring, different development handling
- developed nation =/= ideal nation; 
- assumes that all developing countries are homogeneous and will all respond to same treatment; a one-size-fits-all approach
- reliance on science - post-structuralists such as Foucault (1980) have posited that as a servant of the state, science has been used not just to explain reality, but to produce, control, and normalize reality.
- Contextual Vacuum
- ahistorical
- Ethnocentrism
### Consequences
- “The industrial mode of production, which was no more than one, among many, forms of social life, became the definition of the terminal stage of a unilinear way of social evolution” (Esteva, 1992: 9)
- reduced most of these people into objects to be developed for their own good by the all-knowing development technocrat
- displaced local people (development projects like building of dams)
- replaced culture with monoculture 
-  unemployment, income inequality, and poverty rose

based on an application of the evolutionary concept of Darwin to social change ([[Social Darwinism]])
