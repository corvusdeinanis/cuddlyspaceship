**[[Paradigm]]** vs **Theory**

In Devcom, Dominant Paradigm refers to modernization

### Basic Tenets of Modernization Theory
1. can be achieved by increasing productivity, economic growth, and industrialization
2. causes of underdevelopment - internal causes of the country, individual and existing social structures
3. change can be brought about by changing attitudes, values, beliefs
4. shift from static agricultural, primitive, rigid society to a dynamic, industrialized and social mobility 

### Criticisms of Modernization Theory
- does not consider external constraints
- fails to distinguish between rich and developing countries in terms of resources requiring, different development handling
- developed nation =/= ideal nation; 
- assumes that all developing countries are homogeneous and will all respond to same treatment; a one-size-fits-all approach
