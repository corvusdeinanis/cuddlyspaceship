Does presence of others affect our performance?
## Social Loafing
when we are in a group, your performance level goes down 
contribution reduces when in group

sorta [[Mainstream dilutes movements| more people dilute]]

**reduction in motivation and effort when in a group** 
found in groups where **additive tasks**; all members' work is seen cumulatively; 
(the whole group contributes towards one thing or they share the same task)
inequal distribution of effort 

### ways to reduce:
1. Delegate tasks, clearly defined roles, division of labour
2. Present the task to the right person; based on their interests, their specializations, etc
3. Accountability
4. Prior information about all this should be provided
5. increase the importance of the task (by placing values)
6. Increase group members involvement either by pressure or motivation; morale
7. Set standards that they have to meet; helps them compare; criteria helps more than an abstraction, reference
## Social Facilitiation 
when people are present, performance is increased. 

### Drive theory of social facilitiation
