### Tactics and Strategies to Elicit compliance
**Foot in the Door** - start with a small request and then escalate
**Door in the Face** - ask for a big request / unrealistic request that the person denies, post which the **real** request is asked 
**Low Ball Technique** - making a very attractive initial offer to induce a person to accept the offer and then making the terms less favorable
**Reciprocity** - using reciprocity as leverage
**Pique technique** - exploits curiousity
**Principle of Scarcity** - when things are portrayed to be going extinct, we may buy them even if we don't require them
