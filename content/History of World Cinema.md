## Style

> pre-1907 film is often accused of being more theatrical than cinematic

until 1907, filmmakers concerned
themselves with the individual shot, preserving the spatial aspects

was first one-shot *actualities*^[aka documentaries or just the world as it happened]

## Colour
First, it was hand coloured with delicate brushes
it was arduous

1896 -> hand coloured 
Pathe in 1906 -> patented a mechanical method of colouring the base called **Pathecolor**; aka stencil

Less expensive ways of colouring - 
1. Tinting
2. Toning
3. Mordanting

1899 -> superimposition of red, green, and blue 
1906-> George Albert Smith Kinemacolor; semi-transparent disc divided into two sectors: red and blue-green

1915-> FIRST colour sensitive emulsion invented by Eastman Kodak, was marketed under the trademark Kodachrome

## Sound
[[Silent Film]]


## Industry

France dominated before the World War. Paris was the epicentre of the cinema industry. This shifted to Los Angeles in the 1910s; After WWI, American hegemony of Cinema;  


rise of permanent venues, the nickelodeons that began to appear in numbers in 1906, made the film industry a much more profitable business, encouraging

**1890s - 1910s -> Pre-Hollywood**

**1910** -> start of Hollywood

1913 - Cinema was becoming a more established industry

Different people in different countries. For example - Lumiere Brothers, (?e)

Kinetoscope -> Edison -> 1893
Grand Cafe -> Lumiere Brothers -> Dec 1895
Max Skladanowsky -> few months before Lumiere Brothers' demonstration


### Lumieres' Cinematographe
-> mainly showed documentary material 
and made France an established leader in cinema
### Rise of Hollywood
around 1910, number of companies set up business in a small suburb of Hollywood to the west of LA

rise of the **studio-system** - concentrating production into vast factory-like studios, and by vertically
integrating all aspects of the business, from production to publicity to distribution to
exhibition
### Kinetoscope
**1889**, American inventor Thomas Edison assigned a lab assistant, William Kennedy Dickson, to help develop a device that could produce visuals to accompany the sounds produced from the phonograph
