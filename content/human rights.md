basic rights and freedoms that belong to every person in the world, simply because they are human. 

They are based on the idea that all human beings have **inherent dignity and worth**, and that they should be **treated with respect and fairness**. Human rights are **universal**, meaning that they apply to everyone, everywhere, and at all times

enable and promote peace, justice, and freedom
