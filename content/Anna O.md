- The case of Anna O., who suffered from hysteria, somatic symptoms, and dissociation. Freud and his colleague Breuer hypothesized that her condition was caused by repressed traumatic memories that were brought to consciousness through hypnosis and catharsis.
- The case of Little Hans, who developed a phobia of horses after witnessing a horse collapse and die on the street. Freud attributed his fear to his castration anxiety and his unconscious sexual attraction to his mother.
- The case of the Rat Man, who had obsessive thoughts and compulsions involving rats, torture, and death. Freud traced his obsessions to his childhood experiences of punishment, guilt, and ambivalence towards his father and fianc√©e.
- The case of the Wolf Man, who had a recurring dream of wolves sitting in a tree. Freud analyzed his dream as a symbolic representation of his primal scene, the witnessing of his parents' sexual intercourse, which triggered his neurosis and sexual inhibition.
