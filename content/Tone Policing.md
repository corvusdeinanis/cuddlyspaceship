A form of silencing or dismissing someone's argument or expression by focusing on their tone or emotional state, rather than on the content or validity of their message. Tone policing is often used to derail conversations about social justice issues or to invalidate the experiences of marginalized groups. It implies that there is a right or wrong way to communicate one's feelings or opinions, and that one must be polite, calm, or respectful at all times, regardless of the context or situation
