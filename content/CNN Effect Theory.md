**theory in political science about how media can drive policies**

[[CNN]] is a news channel that broadcasts news 24x7
the stories broadcast have an effect on policymakers and influence policies
influences and shapes public opinion

Because their coverage of an event is important. Their deliberate choice to extensively cover an event, and ignore other content (even if it were more pressing and more important) limits the scope of people. 

- The CNN effect can influence the *public perception* and the *policy agenda* of domestic and foreign issues by *focusing attention* on certain events or topics for prolonged periods of time. This can affect the market values of companies and sectors that are related to the subject matter, as well as the political decisions and actions of governments and organizations.
- The CNN effect can also create a *feedback loop* between the media, the public, and the policymakers, where each actor responds to the others' reactions and expectations. This can *amplify* or *distort* the reality of the situation and create pressure or opportunities for intervention or action.
- The CNN effect can have both positive and negative consequences, depending on how the media outlets present the information, how the public interprets and uses the information, and how the policymakers balance the information with other factors. The CNN effect can increase awareness, accountability, and transparency, but it can also cause overreaction, misinformation, and manipulation.
