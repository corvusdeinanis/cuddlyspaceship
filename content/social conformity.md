According to Kelman,  It can be divided into three categories: 
conformity, compliance, and obedience. 
Conformity is the change in a person's behavior or attitudes to match those of a group, compliance is the act of changing one's behavior in response to a direct request from another person, and obedience is the act of following orders from an authority figure.

In summary, social conformity is the tendency of people to change their behavior or attitudes to match those of a group.
