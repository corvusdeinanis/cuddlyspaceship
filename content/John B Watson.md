American psychologist 
regarded as the founder of [[behaviorism]]. 

He rejected the use of introspection and mental processes as unscientific and instead advocated for the study of observable behaviors and their relation to stimuli. He conducted experiments on animal and human learning, emotion, and motivation. He is famous for his controversial experiment known as the [[Little Albert]] study, in which he conditioned an infant to fear a white rat by pairing it with a loud noise.
