developed by **Prochaska and DiClemente** in the late 1970s
studied smokers who quit by themselves and those who needed further treatment

posits that behavioural change, especially of habits, is **cyclical**

Precontemplation -> Contemplation -> Preparation -> Action -> Maintenance -> Termination

**Precontemplation** - people do not intend to take action in the foreseeable future, they do realize their behaviour is harmful or has negative impact; 
underestimate the pros of changing behaviour and overestimate cons of doing so

**Contemplation** - people intend to take action in the foreseeable future; 
more thoughtful and slightly more balanced view on pros and cons. Might still feel ambivalent about change

**Preparation** / **Determination** - people are ready to take action in the next 30 days. Start taking small steps. Believe that changing behaviour is good

**Action** - people show changes and are willing to put in effort; modify their behaviour

**Maintenance** - have demonstrated change in behaviour for at least 6 months. Intend to maintain change, to not relapse

**Termination** - People no longer want to go back to old behaviour
OR
**Recurrence** - Relapse; very common; but has feelings of guilt and shame, of being a "failure", will have to start again with preparation, action, or maintenance
