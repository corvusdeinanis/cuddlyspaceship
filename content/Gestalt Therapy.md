### Techniques
1) Empty Chair - having the client talk to an empty chair in order to resolve old issues
2) Role plays and re-enactments
3) Dream Work
4) Present Moment Awareness
5) Experimentation Methods (?)

Usage of **"I statements"** instead of assigning a problem to a person; for example - instead of "X is annoying" to "I find it annoying when X does"
