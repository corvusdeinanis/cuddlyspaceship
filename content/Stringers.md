Freelancers who have a working relationship with a news/media agency but are paid per work instead of a regular salary. 

Think Peter Parker submitting photos to the Daily Bugle

Freelance journalists who work on a **contract basis** for news organizations, rather than as full-time employees. 

Stringers typically cover local stories or events that are of interest to a larger audience or market. They may provide written articles, photographs, videos, or audio recordings, depending on their skills and equipment. Stringers are paid per piece or per word, rather than by salary or hourly wage.
