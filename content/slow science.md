movement that advocates for a more thoughtful, methodical, and curiosity-driven approach to scientific research. It opposes the pressure to produce quick and marketable results, and instead supports the value of exploration, collaboration, and public engagement. Slow science also criticizes the current model of research funding, which is seen as biased and limiting. Slow science aims to restore the autonomy, creativity, and relevance of science in society
