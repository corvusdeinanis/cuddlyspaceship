## Renaissance in England
Renaissance - we usually think of Italy but England had its own Renaissance too 

1) Starts with - **Pietro Torrigiano** - Italian Sculptor. Childhood friends with *Michalengelo*. Pietro punched Michalengelo - had to flee Florence - Came to England in 1507 - felt like it was still in Middle Ages
   
   1512, the  King Henry VIII comissioned Pietro to remodel Westminster Abbey - he designed it, he modelled the figures, he cast the bronze, he carved the stone, he gilded the surfaces, did everything. White marble and gilt bronze. 

**Under Henry VIII, it was peaceful for the first time in decades**

2) Swiss-German <u>painter</u> **Hans Holbein** - portrait painter - brought renaissance portrait to Britain, a place where portrait painting was almost non-existent - brought <u>realism</u> - lifelike faces in the whole of British history and they mark the beginning of a major British tradition - a warts-and-all <u> preference for reality over beauty</u> - most famous painting - <u>The Ambassadors</u>

 3) **Nicholas Kratzer** - German mathematician - spirit of scientific inquiry - specialised in miniature sundials - made a sundial with 9 dials 
 4) **Giovanni Damiano** - Italian- AKA **John Damian** - alchemist - was obsessed with human flight - strapped on two large wings - made with hen feathers - tried to fly to Paris - fell in dunghill near the foot of the castle

**Londoners had been concerned that foreigners were stealing their jobs. In 1517, this resentment had bubbled over into outright violence.** 1,000 angry English apprentices gathered - broke into Newgate Prison and freed people - looted foreign craftsmen - New era of Renaissance, with English people and influence 

5) **Thomas Wyatt** - visited Italy - fell in love with Renaissance - was kidnapped - still didn't leave - loved Petrarch - brought back <u>Sonnets</u> - poetry which is much more human - didn't shy away from sex - unglamorous realism to poetry 
   
6) **John Bettes** - brought realism to painting - was trained by Hans 

 **Death of Henry VIII, the long-standing tensions between the old Catholic Church and the new Protestant faith erupted into violence. In the<u> 1550s</u>, over 300 innocent men and women were cruelly and publicly burnt alive for being Protestant**

7) London printer called **John Day** - wanted to document - writer called **John Foxe** - Book of Martyrs - <u> longest book in British history and more than twice as long as the Bible</u> 
   
8) **Thomas Tallis** - Composer - 40 voices song - Spem in Alium - 

9) **John Thynn** - random dude who married Mayor of London's daughter, became rich, was an asshole and a manager from hell - wanted a fancy house - sent a letter everyday to the workers - was impatient - 30 years of building - <u>Longleat </u> - Symettrical, intricate

**Renaissance - age when poets wrote in codes, when artists filled paintings with mysterious symbols… ..and even buildings spoke in riddles**     

10) **Nicholas Hilliard** - goldsmith - made miniature paintings - very delicate and intricate - painted jewels - almost 3D like texture
 
<u>Renaissance Paintings</u> - full of symbols, secrets, figures, inscriptions and emblems, Latin inscriptions and arcane symbols - visual obituary - Clever codes began to be used to conceal things from the Queen and her agents. And one Elizabethan rebel turned disguise into an art form -

12) **John Dee** - actor climbing on to the back of a huge mechanical beetle. And if that wasnt enough, the beetle then took off and flew around the room - illusion - advisor to Queen - made a cryptic painting, still undeciphered - John Dee is telling her to create a British empire  John
