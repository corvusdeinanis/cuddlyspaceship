How stories can propagate [[otherization]]. 
### Quotes
>(talking about a house help boy whose family was ONLY described as "poor" to Adichie)
>Then one Saturday, we went to his village to visit, and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that his brother had made. I was startled. *It had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something*. All I had heard about them was how poor they were, so that **it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor**. 
>**Their poverty was my single story of them.**

> My roommate had a single story of Africa:  
> a single story of catastrophe. In this single story, there was no possibility of Africans
> being similar to her in any way, no possibility of feelings more complex than pity,
> no possibility of a connection as human equals.
> **Her default position toward me, as an African, was a kind of patronizing, well-meaning pity.**

> So, after I had spent some years in the U.S. as an African, I began to understand my roommate's response to me. If I had not grown up in Nigeria, and *if all I knew about Africa were from popular images, I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes, beautiful animals, and incomprehensible people, fighting senseless wars, dying of poverty and AIDS, unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind, white foreigner*.


>The Palestinian poet [[Mourid Barghouti]] writes that **if you want to dispossess a people, the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with, "secondly."**

> I recently spoke at a university where a student told me that it was such a shame that Nigerian men were physical abusers like the father character in my novel. I told him that I had just read a novel called "American Psycho" -- and that it was such a shame that young Americans were serial murderers.

>**But to insist on only these negative stories is to flatten my experience and to overlook the many other stories that formed me. The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete.**

> **They make one story become the only story.**

> The consequence of the single story is this:
> It robs people of dignity.
> It makes our recognition
> of our equal humanity difficult.
> It emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar.

>What if we had an African television network that broadcast diverse African stories all over the world? What the Nigerian writer [[Chinua Achebe]] calls "a balance of stories."


>So that is how to create a single story, show a people as one thing, as only one thing, over and over again, and that is what they become.
>It is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power.
>There is a word, an *Igbo word*, that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world, and it is "***nkali***." *It's a noun that loosely translates to "to be greater than another."*

>Stories too are defined by the principle of **nkali**:
>How they are told, who tells them, when they're told, how many stories are told, are really dependent on power. ***Power** is the ability not just to tell the story of another person, but to make it the definitive story of that person.*
