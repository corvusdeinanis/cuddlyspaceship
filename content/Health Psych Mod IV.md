## Health Behaviour

actions we perform to promote health and avoid conditions that will prevent us from falling sick

Once we form a belief, there is an attitude, we start taking action
belief -> attitude -> actions

At the same time there are people who are very receptive to these, people who are very receptive to things like vaccinations and personal hygiene
