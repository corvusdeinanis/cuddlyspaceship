# **Ableism**

_Discrimination in favour of able-bodied people._

Ableism is rampant throughout our society, devaluing and discriminating against people with physical, intellectual, or psychiatric disabilities. It often comes from the assumption that disabled people need to be ‘fixed’, saved or pitied. In order to combat this it is vital that we are all educating ourselves about the different forms and experiences of disability, ensuring that we are creating accessible and safe spaces, and elevating the voices of people living with disabilities.
