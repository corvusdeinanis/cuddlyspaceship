[[postcolonial]]

- starts with a memory 
- references [[Heart of Darkness]]
	- references characters from it
	- how she has learnt the colonizer's language and education
- her self-doubt, imposter syndrome
	- they manifest as a *Mahakavi* from a temple or a *man in white flannels* who is unerringly English
- identity crisis
- dichotomy
	- violence of language 

- books sit between Gandhi's Experiment with Truth, and something something Crown something 

- displacement, dislocation
