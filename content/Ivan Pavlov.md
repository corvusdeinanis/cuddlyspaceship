Russian physiologist known for [[classical conditioning]], a type of learning in which a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a reflexive response through repeated pairings with another stimulus that naturally elicits that response. He demonstrated this phenomenon using dogs, bells, and food. His research had a major impact on the development of [[behaviorism]]
