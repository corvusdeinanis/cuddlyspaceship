The Miller Test, established by the U.S. Supreme Court in the landmark case of Miller v. California in 1973, 
**legal standard** used to determine whether speech or expression can be legally classified as **obscene**. 
The three-pronged Miller Test considers: 
1) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; 
2) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct or excretory functions as defined by state law; and 
3) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. 
For a work to be deemed obscene, it must satisfy all three criteria.
