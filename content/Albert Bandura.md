Canadian-American psychologist who is known for his social learning theory, which emphasizes the role of observational learning in human behavior. He proposed that people learn not only from their own experiences but also from observing the actions and outcomes of others. He conducted experiments on imitation, aggression, self-efficacy, and self-regulation using models such as live people, films, or cartoons. He also developed the concept of reciprocal determinism,
which states that behavior, cognition, and environment influence each other in a dynamic interaction.
