## Code of Conduct 
Core Principles:
- **Accuracy and Objectivity**: Journalists are obligated to strive for accurate reporting, verifying information from reliable sources and presenting multiple perspectives to ensure a balanced and unbiased view.
 - **Fairness and Impartiality**: Expressing personal opinions as facts is strictly discouraged. Journalists should present all sides of an issue fairly and avoid sensationalizing or misleading narratives.
- **Privacy**: Respecting individuals' right to privacy is crucial. Sensitive information or private details should not be published without consent, unless newsworthiness or public interest outweighs privacy concerns.
 -  **Avoidance of Incitement**: Reporting should not deliberately incite violence, hatred, or communal disharmony.
 - **Defamation**: Publishing false or misleading information that damages someone's reputation is strictly prohibited.
 - **Substantiation**: Assertions and accusations must be supported by credible evidence.
 - **Prejudicial Reporting**: Journalists should avoid prejudicing any ongoing legal proceedings or investigations through their reporting.
 - **Contempt of Court**: Publishing information that undermines the authority or dignity of the judiciary is a punishable offense.
