## Listening Skills
### ACTIVE listening
>*"Psychotherapeutic technique in which the therapist listens closely to a client, asks questions as needed, in order to fully understand the content of the message and the depth of the client's emotion"*
> - APA
- **Empathetic** listening
- Pay attention to **non-verbal cues**

![[Reflective Listening]]
> [!NOTE] Personal Note
> I find this absolutely annoying. It is super vital, because [[private/Semantics and Disagreements|Semantics is important]] but the way it is executed usually is very poor, and jarring. 

### Empathetic Listening
see: [[Case Against Empathy]]
"I understand", "I feel you" statements 
### Non-Verbal Communication 
body language, facial expressions, tone, voice modulation, gestures
they provide additional context 
they must be attuned to the non-verbal cues of the speaker as well as be aware of their own

must not convey disinterest 

### Pointers / Things to remember 
- do not interrupt
- minimal encouragers such as "mhm" and nodding your head to show you're listening
- be sensitive
- suspend judgement 
- open mind
- paraverbal communication
