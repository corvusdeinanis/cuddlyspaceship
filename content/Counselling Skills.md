## Listening Skills
### ACTIVE listening
>*"Psychotherapeutic technique in which the therapist listens closely to a client, asks questions as needed, in order to fully understand the content of the message and the depth of the client's emotion"*
> - APA
- **Empathetic** listening
- Pay attention to **non-verbal cues**

### Reflective Listening 
communication technique in which the listener tries to understand the speaker's idea and then communicates it back to  them to confirm it was understood correctly 

Uses **paraphrasing**, **summarizing**, **mirroring**

#### paraphrasing vs mirroring
paraphrasing - saying the same thing in different words
mirroring - repeating the key parts of the message word for word

#### Why?
- reassurance that you are listening
- confirmation
- ensures everyone is on the same page

> [!NOTE] Personal Note
> I find this absolutely annoying. It is super vital, because [[private/Semantics and Disagreements|Semantics is important]] but the way it is executed usually is very poor, and jarring. 

### Empathetic Listening
see: [[Case Against Empathy]]
"I understand", "I feel you" statements 
### Non-Verbal Communication 
body language, facial expressions, tone, voice moduation, gestures
they provide additional context 
they must be attuned to the non-verbal cues of the speaker as well as be aware of their own

must not convey disinterest 

### Pointers / Things to remember 
- do not interrupt
- minimal encouragers such as "mhm" and nodding your head to show you're listening
- be sensitive
- suspend judgement 
- open mind
- paraverbal communication
