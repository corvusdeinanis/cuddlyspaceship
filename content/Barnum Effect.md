The Barnum Effect is a psychological phenomenon where individuals tend to believe vague and general statements about their personality or behavior that could apply to anyone, known as "**Barnum statements**" as accurate and personal to them. These statements are often presented in the form of personality assessments, horoscopes, fortune-telling, or other forms of divination.

The Barnum Effect is named after the famous American showman and circus owner (and a complete **exploitative** **douchebag**), P.T. Barnum, who reportedly used these types of statements to convince people that his performances were personalized for them. 

The Barnum Effect can occur because *people tend to focus on the parts of the statement that they feel are true about themselves and ignore the parts that do not apply to them*. 
Additionally, people often have a general desire to feel understood and validated, making them more likely to accept statements that seem personalized to them, even if they are not.
