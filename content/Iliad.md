Achilles
WHO IS ACHILLES?
Achilles was a hero of the Trojan War, the
greatest of all the Greek warriors, and is the
central character of Homer's Iliad. He was the
son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus, king of
Phthia.
ACHILLES IN THE TROJAN WAR
● Achilles' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the
slaying of the Trojan prince Hector outside the gates of
Troy. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in
the Iliad, other sources concur that he was killed near the
end of the Trojan War by Paris, who shot him with an
arrow.
● He was invulnerable except for one part of his body, the
was his heel.
ACHILLES’ CHARACTER
● The Romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy, took a highly negative
view of Achilles. Virgil refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of
men,while Horace portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children.Other
writers, such as Catullus, Propertius, and Ovid, represent a second strand of
disparagement, with an emphasis on Achilles' erotic career. This strand
continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as Dictys
Cretensis and Dares Phrygius and in Benoît de Sainte-Maure's Roman de Troie,
which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the Matter of Troy
until the 17th century.
● But he is most widely recognized as a brave and valiant soldier vulnerable only at
the heel and ofcourse matters of the heart.
